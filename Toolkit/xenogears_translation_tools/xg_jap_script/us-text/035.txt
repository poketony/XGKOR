Soon this area will be
totally excavated...{enter}
We'll have to find 
another place with 
buried treasure...

#### 2 ####
Running into those army
guys is real dangerous...{enter}
If they find new ruins,
they'll take them over
for themselves...{enter}
So,{wait:0A} I wonder where
the best place is?

#### 3 ####
Shh!
I'm trying to think.
So, keep it down.

#### 4 ####
Since the army no longer
controls the dig sites,
you can go by yourself...{enter}
Now the buying prices at
the 'Ethos' workshop
have gone down.
What should we do?

#### 5 ####
I came here looking for 
fortune...but all the
good sites are controlled
by the military.{enter}
I'll have to go home a
failure. What should I do?

#### 6 ####
I wanted to try my luck 
at treasure hunting.{enter}
I'm pretty successful.
The reason is I found a
good partner.{enter}
Even now he's looking at 
a map, analyzing our next
step. I sure depend on my
pal.

   - Come to Dazil! -
 
 If you dig in the ruins, 
   you too can be rich!
