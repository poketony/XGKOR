My brother is such a 
child, always playing
hide-and-seek. {enter}
What a laugh. I wonder 
where he's hiding now?

My brother says he's
over playing hide-and-
seek. But now he has
nothing to do.{enter}
He's probably just
wandering around the
area. He's still such
a child.

That kid is amazing. 
Since her father has 
been away she's been 
running the store all
by herself.

#### 4 ####
My dad came back. {wait:32}
I was helping him in the
store but he told me to
go play somewhere.
