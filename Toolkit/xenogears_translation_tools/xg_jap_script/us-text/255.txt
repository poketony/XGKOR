Sigurd
"Young master, according to
Margie, there's quite a
troublemaker in Gebler."

#### 2 ####
Bart
"Yeah...
So, who the heck is he?"

#### 3 ####
Sigurd
"Kahran Ramsus{wait:0A} of the Holy
Solaris Empire's Special
Foreign Affairs Agency{wait:05}...{enter}
In other words, he's the
commander in chief of
Gebler.{enter}
It seems that Gebler isn't
just after the excavation
sites around Aveh after
all."

#### 4 ####
Bart
"You mean, they're not
after the Jasper?"

#### 5 ####
Sigurd
"If that's their only goal
they wouldn't need to send
an important man like him!{enter}
Young master, this could
become unexpectedly
complicated..."

#### 6 ####
Fei
"Doc hasn't come
back yet, has he?"

#### 7 ####
...

#### 8 ####
Sigurd
"Hyu...{wait:0A} I mean,{wait:0A} 'doc'...{wait:0A}
No need to worry about him.
He'll join us soon."

#### 9 ####
Sigurd
"Deus integrated with
Zohar and awoke...{enter}
But we've found out Deus
is in the center of the
giant structure created
out of the fallen Merkava.{enter}
The only way we can think
of to destroy Deus is to
penetrate into there and
make our way to the center.{enter}
That structure used to be
Merkava itself, but we
must assume the inside has
changed significantly.{enter}
We don't know what dangers
await inside of there.{wait:0A}
Please be very careful.

#### 10 ####
Fei
"Yeah, thanks Sigurd.
Let me take care of it.{enter}
I will destroy Deus.{wait:1E}
Even if it costs me
everything I have..."

#### 11 ####
Bart
"Fei...{wait:1E}
Are you sure
about this?"

#### 12 ####
Fei
"Bart...?"

#### 13 ####
Bart
"I know what you must be
thinking now.
If you destroy Deus...{enter}
...the proliferation of the
nanomachines that are out
to turn this planet itself
into a weapon will stop...{enter}
But, if you end up losing
Elly who was united with
Deus for that very purpose,
then what good will it be?"

#### 14 ####
Bart
"Fei...{wait:1E}
Are you sure
about this?"

#### 15 ####
Fei
"Bart...?"

#### 16 ####
Bart
"I know what you must be
thinking now.
If you destroy Deus...{enter}
...the proliferation of the
nanomachines that are out
to turn this planet itself
into a weapon will stop...{enter}
But, if you end up losing
Elly who was united with
Deus for that very purpose,
then what good will it be?"

#### 17 ####
Fei
"But..."

#### 18 ####
Sigurd
"That's right, Fei.{wait:14}
She's our friend who's been
through a lot with us too.{enter}
I think that saving a dear
friend is just as important
as protecting our planet or
saving the world...{enter}
What better reason is there
to fight? If you can't even
save your friends, then how
could you save the world?{enter}
Don't you agree?"

#### 19 ####
Bart
"Yeah, Sig's right!{wait:14}
Don't you ever give up,
Fei, no matter what!{enter}
You're the only one
who can release Elly
from Deus' spell.{enter}
But, we'll give you as
much backup as we can.{wait:0A}
So..."

#### 20 ####
Bart
"Yeah, Sig's right!{wait:14}
Don't you ever give up,
Fei, no matter what!{enter}
You're the only one
who can release Elly
from Deus' spell.{enter}
But, we'll give you as
much backup as we can.{wait:0A}
So..."

#### 21 ####
Fei
"Thanks a lot.{wait:14}
Bart, Sigurd...{wait:0A}
I won't give up."

#### 22 ####
Sigurd
"You volunteered to fight
for the young master and
the rest of us.{enter}
So it's our turn to fight
for you and Elly.
Let's go, Fei...{wait:0A}
to gain true freedom!!"

#### 23 ####
Sigurd
"We don't have much time
left.{wait:0A} Let's go, to win
ourselves true freedom!!"

#### 24 ####
Sigurd
"Ready to go to Sargasso?"
    Sure!
    Wait a minute!

#### 25 ####
Sigurd
"It seems Fei isn't
in the infirmary...{enter}
But he must be
onboard somewhere..."

#### 26 ####
Sigurd
"Let's head to the
excavation site."

#### 27 ####
Sigurd
"Let's hurry to
the Thames!!"

#### 28 ####
Sigurd
"Some new parts were
brought into our Gear
Shop down below.{enter}
Why don't you go and
check them out!?"

#### 29 ####
Sigurd
"We have arrived at the
transport ship.{wait:0A}
Be careful now, Billy..."

#### 30 ####
Sigurd
"Good morning.{wait:0A}
Billy is waiting
in the gun room."

#### 31 ####
(U...ugh...{wait:0A}
Feels like a hangover...)

#### 32 ####
Sigurd
"Billy is waiting
in the gun room."

#### 33 ####
Sigurd
"I see. So, Fei'll recover
if he continues to rest.
I'm relieved to hear that.{enter}
It seems the orphanage is
located to the southeast of
the 'Ethos' headquarters."

#### 34 ####
Sigurd
"It appears the 'Ethos'
headquarters is located
to the north of the Thames.{enter}
We must hurry up and take
Fei there..."

#### 35 ####
Sigurd
"That reminds me... Margie
says that she has something
to talk to you about..."

#### 36 ####
Sigurd
"Fei is unconscious...?"

#### 37 ####
Sigurd
"How careless of me.{wait:0A}
I never thought Elly would
do a thing like that...{enter}
Why don't you go and
see how she is, Fei?"

#### 38 ####
Sigurd
"Young master, where did
you go while we were so
busy...?{enter}
An international goodwill
visit with the Thames?
Well, whatever...{enter}
Now about those supplies
for the submarine..."

#### 39 ####
Bart
"Oh, that?{wait:0A}
Let me see...order an
additional 16 torpedoes!"

#### 40 ####
Sigurd
"Yes, sir."

#### 41 ####
Sigurd
"The young master has
finally started to realize
his position as a king."

#### 42 ####
Sigurd
"Fei, sorry to ask but...{wait:0A}
Would you mind telling the
young master to come here?"

#### 43 ####
Sigurd
"Young master...
You shouldn't play pranks
in an unknown land!"

#### 44 ####
Sigurd
"Where one god disdains,
another god shows mercy.{enter}
We have to appreciate
people's good intentions."

#### 45 ####
Sigurd
"Young master...
You should apologize
to the two of them."

#### 46 ####
Sigurd
"Forgive me, Hyuga...{wait:0A}
I couldn't save Fei
and Elly..."

#### 47 ####
Sigurd
"We shall have to enter
into Nisan through the
secret road.{enter}
Let's keep on the lookout
for a lone tree in the
desert as a sign of where
the road lies buried...!"

#### 48 ####
Sigurd
"It's time to sneak
into Aveh at last.{enter}
First of all, our party
should inspect the town
and work out a plan of
action."

#### 49 ####
Sigurd
"We're almost at the
hideout...{enter}
We'll probably stop
there for a while for
supplies and repairs."

#### 50 ####
Sigurd
"Shall we launch
the Yggdrasil?"{enter}
    {fast:FF}Go ahead!
    Wait a while.

#### 51 ####
Sigurd
"We are currently
anchored at Shevat..."{enter}
    {fast:FF}Leave Shevat.
    Changed my mind.

#### 52 ####
Bart
"Our Yggdrasil was reborn
with Shevat technology.{enter}
This vessel will be
named 'the Third'!"

#### 53 ####
Bart
"Our Yggdrasil was reborn
with Shevat technology.{enter}
This vessel will be
named 'the Third'!"

#### 54 ####
Sigurd
"The operations are a
bit different from the
previous Yggdrasil.{enter}
So you'll have to
learn the workings
all over again!"

#### 55 ####
Yes!{wait:0A}
I'll do my best!

#### 56 ####
Sigurd
"We're currently anchored
at the Thames..."{enter}
    {fast:FF}Leave Thames.
    Changed my mind.

#### 57 ####
Sigurd
"So this is your first
time to see our new
Yggdrasil II...{enter}
Let me show you our
reborn vessel's
improved performance!"

#### 58 ####
Sigurd
"Currently anchored
at Nisan...{enter}
    {fast:FF}Leave Nisan.
    Changed my mind.

#### 59 ####
Sigurd
"Currently anchored
at our hideout..."{enter}
    {fast:FF}Leave the hideout.
    Changed my mind.

#### 60 ####
Bart
"We went through a
lot together...{enter}
But this one's going to
be really tough...{wait:0A}
But, we won't die! {wait:0A}
We'll come back alive!{enter}
I'll be asking you to
join me again when
this is all over!"

#### 61 ####
Bart
"I can go anytime!"

#### 62 ####
Bart
"Sig is drinking in
the gun room."

#### 63 ####
Bart
"I can go anytime!"

#### 64 ####
Bart
"We're almost at
my hideout!"

#### 65 ####
!{clear:14}

#### 66 ####
If Sigurd passes away,
I will...!

#### 67 ####
Young master, would
you let me steer once
in a while, please!?

#### 68 ####
Yahoo!!{wait:0A}
He'll let me be an
apprentice helmsman!"

#### 69 ####
Yggdrasil III can fly
now, thanks to Shevat's 
technology but...{enter}
The operations have
changed a little so
I've gotta study
them all over again.{enter}
Wanna see my notes?
    {fast:FF}Let me see them
    Not right now

#### 70 ####
{fast:FF}1){wait:0A} The ¡÷ button is the
   accelerator.
   It moves you forward
   really fast!!{enter}
2){wait:0A} If you press the
   Directional button with
   the ¡÷ button held down,
   you can...{enter}
 go down by pressing Up,
 go up by pressing Down,
 and change direction by
 pressing Left or Right.{enter}
3){wait:0A} When you want to turn
 quickly, also press the
 L1 button for left, or
 the R1 button for right.{enter}
4){wait:0A} You can reverse by
   pressing the R2 button.{enter}
5){wait:0A} Press the ¡õ button
   to go to the bridge.
   Press the ¡ð button
   to land.{enter}
 But note...
 There are places where
 you cannot land, such as
 mountains and forests.{enter}
 But then again that was
 the same conditions the
 Yggdrasil had when it
 was a Sand Cruiser.

#### 71 ####
My name is Bingo, the
apprentice helmsman.{wait:0A}
Sigurd has been teaching me
how to operate the Yggdrasil!{enter}
Do you want to see my notes?
    {fast:FF}Yeah, let me see them
    Not right now, thanks

#### 72 ####
{fast:FF}1){wait:0A} The Yggdrasil can be
   operated just as if you are
   walking... Just use the
   Directional button to move
   in the direction you want.{enter}
2){wait:0A} While cruising, if you want
   to stop and disembark in
   your Gear, then just press
   the ¡ð button.{enter}
   To stop and come back to
   the bridge (that is, here),
   press the ¡õ button.{enter}
   From the bridge, you can go
   into the rest of the vessel{wait:05}
   to rest,{wait:05} tune up a Gear,{wait:05}
   weigh yourself{wait:05} and so on!{enter}
3){wait:0A} While cruising, press the
   Select button to activate
   the Remote Sensing System.{wait:0A}
   It will map your current
   position.{enter}
4){wait:0A} When you don't know how to
   get to where you want to go,
   ask the navigation officer,
   Mr. Alei, who's looking in
   the binoculars there.{enter}
   He will be able to show you
   the ship's charts.

#### 73 ####
I can't wait until I become
a fully-fledged helmsman...

#### 74 ####
The ship's missiles might
not work on that monster...

#### 75 ####
Suddenly we've gone from
land to air travel...
From two dimensions to
three dimensions...
This is difficult...

#### 76 ####
Exchange all the torpedo
tubes to missile launchers.
We can shoot Gungany...I
mean, 'Bart Missiles', too!

#### 77 ####
By the way, how do
you shoot downwards?

#### 78 ####
So how's the status of
our ammo supplies...
Hmm, maybe we need more
anti-aircraft shells...

#### 79 ####
The compass we received
from Shevat is great.
You can aim at 15 different 
targets simultaniously!

#### 80 ####
My dear artillery
guns, keep it up!

#### 81 ####
The command of view is
better than the desert...
It's ideal for observing
missile detonation.
The giant splashes should
be really easy to spot.

#### 82 ####
Water torpedoes are
built much more simply
than sand torpedoes.{enter}
Thanks to that, their
power is double that of
our previous ship's arms.
But they're expensive.

#### 83 ####
Man, my legs
move great!

#### 84 ####
Do they have ammo that
works with our vessel here?
It's about time to change the
radar to water software too!

#### 85 ####
I didn't think they would
have such a variety of water
torpedoes. Their normal
torpedoes are not bad either.{enter}
There're so many of them
that I can't decide...!

#### 86 ####
When it comes to cannons, 
you don't know where the
shells will fly to until
you've actually shot'em.{enter}
But, they're suitable
for the pirating trade
because they're cheap
yet intimidating...{enter}
On the other hand though,
torpedoes blow everything
to blazes and are down-
right expensive too...

#### 87 ####
It's dry in the desert so
gunpowder burns steadily
and easy to predict.{enter}
It'd be great if the
temperature would stay
the same day and night.

#### 88 ####
This ship's mast is low.{wait:0A}
So it'd help if we could
get a Gear to observe
the shells' impacts...{enter}
And when the catapults
are opened, you can't
use the main cannon.{wait:0A}
Ahh, so many problems...

#### 89 ####
The azimuth compass wasn't
in its proper position.
I'd better fix it while we
are at an anchorage...

#### 90 ####
I want to change this to
a firing radar with a
better filter...
Oh, and I'd love a bigger
torpedo tube, too...

#### 91 ####
Franz
"Oh, young master!{wait:0A}
I...I'm not loafing
on the job! Honest!"

#### 92 ####
...{clear:0A}

#### 93 ####
Franz
"Oh, {wait:0A}sorry...{wait:0A}
I didn't realize that you
were there! {enter}
Wanna hear some hot sounds
that I have recorded?"
    {fast:FF}Sure.
    No thanks.

#### 94 ####
Franz
"Wanna hear some more?"
    {fast:FF}Yeah, this is cool!
    No, enough already!

#### 95 ####
Franz
"Ahh...
Well that's too bad."

#### 96 ####
Franz
"That's too bad...{wait:0A}
You could have seen the
world between the static!"

#### 97 ####
{fast:FF}'The Franz Collection'
     Number {number(s):00}

#### 98 ####
I'm finally getting used
to being in the sky...{wait:0A}
But I shouldn't get too
relaxed yet!

#### 99 ####
I still break into a cold 
sweat everytime I take off
and land.

#### 100 ####
...In short, it flies
cause it has wings, right?
This is hard to understand!

#### 101 ####
Hmm, so in water the rudder
has to be gently engaged
before trying to turn.
Guess I learned something.

#### 102 ####
Wow, to think something
like a Lemora would be
in the ocean... It was
covered in shells!

#### 103 ####
I had a competition going  
on with the young master
the other day to see who
could tip the boat further.{enter}
Old Maison literally was
white as a sheet, saying
all the teacups were
destroyed...

#### 104 ####
There was a desert Lemora
plastered all over the 
bottom of the ship.
No wonder we didn't get 
any speed...

#### 105 ####
...{wait:0A}
Let's put more
oomph into it!!

#### 106 ####
High-speed three-dimensional
maneuvering? ... Impossible!
I'm not a Gear pilot! Hah! But
then again, I've got no choice!

#### 107 ####
With the booster,
the acceleration
is monsterous!
It's fun though.

#### 108 ####
How to use the rudder...
Deploy the slats
simultaneously...
like this... Hmm?
What's a Vortex Flow?

#### 109 ####
...Wingtip-stalls...
hammerhead-stalls...
the Helpst maneuver...
grumble... grumble...

#### 110 ####
Hmmm, the rudder doesn't work
as well as it did in sand...
It doesn't feel secure or
seem to be reliable at all!

#### 111 ####
I'm kind of used to it now.
You can move more freely in
the water, once you know how!

#### 112 ####
It's a lot harder to
control the ship after the
young master steered it.
He is so reckless...

#### 113 ####
We had a lot happen this time.
I'd better take a good look
at those propulsion wheels!

#### 114 ####
All I've heard is
static since then...{enter}
I hope people are still
alive out there...

#### 115 ####
Shevat uses a special
communication method...{wait:0A}
I was ordered to work out
a system to decode it on
our ship...{wait:0A} I hope I can!

#### 116 ####
Three dimension radio
wave lighthouse?{wait:0A}
We need new Navi-soft!{enter}
And they expect me to
create it all...
Yeah, right...!?

#### 117 ####
Franz is sulky and
won't help me...

#### 118 ####
Shevat's communication decoder,{wait:0A}
charts of angular cordinates of
the radio wave lighthouse and
it's pulses,{wait:0A} table of guidance
communication code settings...{enter}
There're so many things we
need to buy.{wait:0A}
Things have gotten a lot more
complicated and expensive,
now that we can fly!

#### 119 ####
Laser communication...{wait:0A}
I, {wait:05}I want it so bad...

#### 120 ####
We had a lot of trouble
with static electricity in
the desert causing noise.

#### 121 ####
We can use high frequency
radio waves in the water,
but the resolution is low,
so it's hard to make out.

#### 122 ####
...With the increase in
usable radio waves, my
work load has increased.{wait:0A}
I'm happy but I'm busy!

#### 123 ####
We increased the antennas,
but now I can't keep track
of everything because I
don't have enough selector
channels...{wait:0A} Drats!!

#### 124 ####
Once I get to a good
stopping point I guess I'll
go get me a standard
communications oscillator.

#### 125 ####
The usable electric waves
have increased, so now the
layout of the antenna mast
needs to be changed too!

#### 126 ####
While under the sand, there
is nothing but static...{wait:0A}
As a matter of fact, there
is nothing to do either...

#### 127 ####
Sand conducts sound much
better than air does.{wait:0A}
Why, I can hear every
gripe Shakhan says!{wait:0A}
Ha... Just kidding!

#### 128 ####
Our maps are not much
of a help anymore...

#### 129 ####
Young master, do you have
any idea where we are?{wait:0A}
It's not on my map!

#### 130 ####
It's not on the map...{wait:0A}
Where the heck are we?

#### 131 ####
I got a new map!

#### 132 ####
Do you want to see
the ship's chart?
    {fast:FF}Yeah, show me!
    No thanks.

#### 133 ####
Alright then...{wait:0A}
Let me know when you
want to see it...{wait:0A}
It's no loss to me anyway.

#### 134 ####
That Jerico is serious!{wait:0A}
I should put more oomph 
into it, too!

#### 135 ####
I thought I'd have more free
time. But I have to fix up
Jerico's mistakes, so now
I'm busier than before...

#### 136 ####
I hope Jerico doesn't go
learning any more strange
things ever again...

#### 137 ####
I don't have to do delicate
effect wing movements anymore,
but it's harder to keep
balance than it was on sand.

#### 138 ####
I must inspect the
extended main tank now.
I'm not used to it yet.

#### 139 ####
This ship uses innumerable
effect wings to pulverize
sand and wade through it.{enter}
If our balance is lost, 
we roll over in the desert.{wait:0A}
It's all up to our skill!

#### 140 ####
I have to repair some of
the pumps that died now.
Oh, I also have to re-cover
the effect wings...

#### 141 ####
The map needs to be
rewritten because of
what's happened!

#### 142 ####
If you ignore the time 
scale, there isn't much
change in the workload.

#### 143 ####
Look! Look!
The aerial picture matches
the map I made a long time
ago...exactly! I'm filled
with such deep emotion.

#### 144 ####
It's a small world.
I already remember all
the land, sea and air!!

#### 145 ####
A chart! 
I need to go buy a chart!

#### 146 ####
The captain here is a
good guy! He taught me
a lot about the sea.
But he's a mean drunk!

#### 147 ####
I was kind of discouraged
that there are so many
unmapped places...{enter}
But at the same time,
I was happy to be able
to write new charts...

#### 148 ####
The ocean is so huge...
The desert at least had
some kind of landmarks
to look for...{enter}
Now I can't just rely
on knowing the land.
I've also got to master
celestial measurement.

#### 149 ####
Jerico has been careful
lately, so navigation
has been made easier.

#### 150 ####
Oh, that's the chief
navigator's banana boat.
Look at the map.{wait:0A}
The desert may seem to be
flat and boring but it's
actually quite complicated.{enter}
It's even worse when you
dive underground...
Unexpected boulders and
underground waterways...
You can't take your eyes
off that map for a second!

#### 151 ####
That Jerico! He lets the
Yggdrasil drift, so that
the time and routes we
take end up being off...

#### 152 ####
The desert changes everyday.
So I rewrite the map with
the information we collect
whenever we're out there.

#### 153 ####
The map box is the greatest
treasure in the Yggdrasil!{wait:0A}
This ship can run amuck
because it has these maps.{wait:0A}
They're all hand-made by me!

#### 154 ####

"No problem!{enter}
He's probably wining

"What about the 'Ethos'?
They've completely
devastated themselves!{enter}
That mob just goes from
bad to worse!"

#### 170 ####
Citan
"Do you not think it is
about time you told your
son the truth, old friend?{enter}
You were not just
wandering around drinking
and picking fights, were
you?{enter}
I am sure he wants to
know what you have been
up to...{wait:0A}
Is that right, Billy?"

#### 171 ####
Citan
"Do you not think it is
about time you told your
son the truth, old friend?{enter}
You were not just
wandering around drinking
and picking fights, were
you?{enter}
I am sure he wants to
know what you have been
up to...{wait:0A}
Is that right, Billy?"

#### 172 ####
Billy
"Yes, it would certainly
make me feel a lot better.{enter}
I now know my dad was
worried about me the whole
time, but I haven't worked
out my feelings yet..."

#### 173 ####
Jessie
"What do you mean?"

#### 174 ####
Billy
"Well I'm glad Prim can
speak now, but she only
calls out for her father...{enter}
But I am the one who has
been taking care of her
all this time...{wait:0A}
What's wrong with her...?"

#### 175 ####
Citan
"Calm down,{wait:0A} Billy...{wait:0A}
I am sure she is just
being shy.{enter}
She will start calling out
for you soon.{wait:0A} Why, my own
daughter does not even call
out her father's name!"

#### 176 ####
Citan
"So, old friend...{wait:0A}
Why were you working
alone all that time?"

#### 177 ####
Citan
"Calm down,{wait:0A} Billy....{wait:0A}
I am sure she is just
being shy.{enter}
She will start calling out
for you soon.{wait:0A} Why, my own
daughter does not even call
out her father's name!"

#### 178 ####
Citan
"So, old friend...{wait:0A}
Why were you working
alone all that time?"

#### 179 ####
Jessie
"It couldn't be helped...{wait:0A}
Anyway, I'll probably need
your help from here on..."

#### 180 ####
Jessie
"Okay, I'll tell you more.{wait:0A}
Let's go to the gun room...{wait:0A}
to get something to drink."

#### 181 ####
Fei
"That {wait:0A}can't be!"

#### 182 ####
Billy
"A secondary
explosion...!?"

#### 183 ####
Citan
"Oh no!{wait:0A}
I should have known better.
What a miscalculation!!{enter}
The explosion was too big.{wait:0A}
It reacted with the main
condenser right under
the main cannon...{enter}
...and induced a
secondary explosion...{wait:0A}
How could I have been
so stupid!?"

#### 184 ####
Bart
"You mean,{wait:0A}
we overdid it!?"

#### 185 ####
Citan
"Why did I not
realize it sooner!?{enter}
This means...{wait:0A}
We might have...
Oh no, Elly...!"

#### 186 ####
Fei
"Oh...{wait:0A}oh my gosh...{wait:0A}
Elly...!!"

#### 187 ####
Billy
"W,what is it,{wait:0A}
this time?"

#### 188 ####
Bart
"Hey, {wait:0A}Citan!
What more is going
to happen!?"

#### 189 ####
Citan
"Something is happening in
the center of Merkava...{wait:0A}
What could it be...!?"

#### 190 ####
Billy
"Thank you for helping
me, everyone.{enter}
To be honest, that was
too dangerous for me on
my own. I couldn't have
done it without you..."

#### 191 ####
Bart
"Is your job always this
dangerous?{enter}
Hah, I never thought you
would call a Gear!?{wait:0A}
But, what in hell is the
'Ethos' thinking anyway?"

#### 192 ####
Bart
"Is your job always this
dangerous?{enter}
Hah, I never thought you
would call a Gear!?{wait:0A}
But, what in hell is the
'Ethos' thinking anyway?"

#### 193 ####
Billy
"!!{wait:0A} ...{wait:05}We Etones
are merely fulfilling
our divine mission!"

#### 194 ####
Bart
"Sorry...{wait:0A} It was wrong of
me to say that.{wait:0A} Don't take
it so seriously!{enter}
So, you're going to report
back to the 'Ethos' about
your job's results, right?{enter}
Well, if you like we shall
give you a ride to the
'Ethos' H.Q...{wait:0A}
It's on our way."

#### 195 ####
Bart
"Sorry...{wait:0A} It was wrong of
me to say that.{wait:0A} Don't take
it so seriously!{enter}
So, you're going to report
back to the 'Ethos' about
your job's results, right?{enter}
Well, if you like we shall
give you a ride to the
'Ethos' H.Q...{wait:0A}
It's on our way."

#### 196 ####
Billy
"That would be great,
so long as it doesn't
put you out...{enter}
I have something to
give you as a sign of
my gratitude.{enter}
So please accompany
me into the 'Ethos'
headquarters.
Let's go..."

#### 197 ####
Citan
"'Anonelbe'...{enter}
The long awaited man of
god, who will take the
people born in this world
with him to a new horizon.{enter}
Such is the destiny of
the 'Contact'.{wait:0A}
That is what the emperor
called Fei...{enter}
He did not tell me why he
called Fei that though..."

#### 198 ####
Sigurd
"Who the heck is he then?"

#### 199 ####
Citan
"He is Fei.{wait:1E}
But he is also the one
who...{enter}
destroyed Elru,{wait:0A} caused Kahr
serious injury,{wait:0A} sank the
Yggdrasil,{wait:0A} killed Rico's
subordinate's in Kislev...{enter}
...{wait:0A}
Need I continue further?{wait:0A}
He is{wait:05}...{wait:05}
{wait:05}...{wait:0A}Id.

#### 200 ####
Sigurd
"What did you say!?{wait:0A}
Id!?"

#### 201 ####
Jessie
"What do you mean?"

#### 202 ####
Citan
"He{wait:05}...{wait:0A}Fei that is,{wait:0A} has
Disassociative Identity
Disorder...{enter}
Also known more commonly as
multiple personalities."

#### 203 ####
Jessie
"D...{wait:05}disas...?"

#### 204 ####
Citan
"Disassociative Identity
Disorder...{wait:0A}
or multiple personalities.{enter}
It is a mental disorder
where one person has
multiple personalities."

#### 205 ####
Sigurd
"That can't be real..."

#### 206 ####
Citan
"Oh but it is very real!{wait:0A}
Fei is living proof of it.{enter}
I have been watching over
Fei, who has a destroyer
personality within him
named 'Id'."

#### 207 ####
Citan
"In the beginning he was
stable...{enter}
His disassociation did not
occur at all while he
lived in Lahan for those
three years.{enter}
But then, after Lahan was
attacked, things changed.{enter}
Little by little, the
number of incidences of his
disassociation and their
length began to increase.{enter}
And then at Solaris, a
complete manifestation
of Id occurred."

#### 208 ####
Sigurd
"What brought it about?{wait:0A}
He was fine when he
was in Lahan, right?"

#### 209 ####
Citan
"My guess is that{wait:05}...{wait:0A}
the appearance of Grahf
affected Fei somehow.{enter}
You probably know that Fei
worked with Grahf as the
assasin 'Id' before he was
brought to live in Lahan.{enter}
It was then that Elru,{wait:05}
the homeland of Dominia,{wait:05}
was utterly obliterated.{enter}
Grahf was intentionally
provoking the manifestation
of Id{wait:0A} 'within'{wait:05}...{wait:05}for want
of a better word{wait:05}...{wait:0A}Fei."

#### 210 ####
Jessie
"For what purpose?"

#### 211 ####
Citan
"To destroy God{wait:05}...{wait:0A}
That is what Grahf
was saying...{enter}
That is all I know...
Although there might be
more to it...{wait:0A}
But one thing is certain...{enter}
Grahf was encouraging the
manifestation of Id, but
did not have adequate
control over him."

#### 212 ####
Sigurd
"In other words, it
was too much for him
to handle?"

#### 213 ####
Citan
"Yes."

#### 214 ####
Jessie
"You said, 'That's all you
know, although there might
be more to it.'...{enter}
What did you mean by that?"

#### 215 ####
Citan
"I shall go on to explain
that now.{wait:0A} Actually, that is
the most important point."

#### 216 ####
Billy
"Well then...
shall we go, too?"

#### 217 ####
I've picked up the 'Ethos' fleet
and the Thames on the radar, sir.{wait:0A}
They're on the sea south of here.{wait:0A}
If we travel at full speed we can
reach them in an hour.

#### 218 ####
Sigurd
"Alright!{wait:0A}
Set sail for Thames!"

#### 219 ####
Aye, aye, sir!

#### 220 ####
First mate!{wait:0A}
The radar sir...!

#### 221 ####
Sigurd
"What is it!?"

#### 222 ####
The radar just detected
an enormous object!{wait:0A}
It appeared straight
above the fleet!

#### 223 ####
Bart
"Don't tell me Stone's
there already!?"

#### 224 ####
Bart
"Don't tell me Stone's
there already!?"

#### 225 ####
No, it is much
bigger than that!{wait:0A}
I estimate it's at
least 2000 sharls!

#### 226 ####
Billy
"That's gigantic...{wait:0A}
What in the heavens
is happening...?"

#### 227 ####
