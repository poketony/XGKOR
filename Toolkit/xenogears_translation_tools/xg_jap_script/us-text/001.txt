Fei
"Oh, he's just hanging
about over there...{enter}
He's thinking about his
sister's marriage and
doesn't seem to be able
to calm down.{enter}
He likes to talk and act
big, but he really is
still just a kid...
It's kinda cute, huh?"

#### 2 ####
Fei
"He's probably around here
somewhere... getting up
to his usual mischief!"

#### 3 ####
Fei
"Phew!
That was a close one...{enter}
This well is dangerous...{wait:14}
Perhaps it's better if I
don't go near it again."

#### 4 ####
Fei
"Hey...{wait:14}
What are you talking
about, Dan?{enter}
Timothy and Alice are both
my best friends.{wait:14}
You know I can't do that!"

#### 5 ####
Fei
"Alright Dan,
you've got it...{enter}
I guess I'll just go sweep
Alice away and make a run
for it!"

#### 6 ####
"Timothy is a balding
headed fool! And his dad
is bald and stupid too!"

#### 7 ####
"Mountain path ahead!
Beware of the HP
gobbling hob-gobs!!{enter}
Those wishing to see the
doctor on the mountain top
should proceed with courage
and conviction."

#### 8 ####
"Alice and Fei
are in looove!!"

#### 9 ####
"From all the cool
people of Lahan...
  Buon giorno!"

#### 10 ####
"- The Laughing Fox  
   & Piglet Tavern - 
   Drunks welcome!  "

#### 11 ####
" - Lahan's General Store - 
    You want it?
    We've got it...(maybe)! "

#### 12 ####
Received a chill from the
depths of the cistern!
Oh 'well'...!

#### 13 ####
'Well, well, well!'
You found a Power Ring!!

#### 14 ####
'All's well that ends well!'
You found an Aquasol S!!

#### 15 ####
'Well' done!{wait:14}
You found a
weird item!!

#### 16 ####
'High' there Fei!{enter}
Did you know that beyond
that black forest lies the
great kingdom of Aveh?{enter}
It's got a big capital
city with lots of people
living there.{enter}
My father is working
somewhere in Aveh.

#### 17 ####
Soon, my father is going
to come pick mother and
me up so that we can all
live together in Aveh.

#### 18 ####
Oh, father!
Please come home soon...

#### 19 ####
Hey hey, Fei!
Let's go catch some
scampi again sometime!

#### 20 ####
I'm gonna get you!{clear:28}

#### 21 ####
Hey hey, Fei!
Help me find another
elephantsparrow's
nest sometime, okay!!?

#### 22 ####
Run away!{clear:28}

#### 23 ####
Hey, Fei. Next time,
teach me more of your
kung fu stuff.

#### 24 ####
I'm gonna get you!{clear:28}

#### 25 ####
Hey, Fei!
Let's go tease
the girls again!

#### 26 ####
Run away!{clear:28}

#### 27 ####
Birds are great...{wait:14}
They can fly so high in
the sky and go wherever
they want to...

#### 28 ####
You know Fei...{wait:14} Mom
was saying that you
might have come from
a far away place...

#### 29 ####
If you were a bird,
you could fly back
to your real home
anytime you wanted.

#### 30 ####
Dan
"Well, the least we can
do is pray for Alice's
happiness, hey Fei!"

#### 31 ####
Dan
"So Fei, you up to it?{enter}
C'mon, let's do it!{wait:14}
    Let's do it!!
    Quit bein' foolish 

#### 32 ####
Dan
"Oh good, Fei!
Ya ready to talk?"

#### 33 ####
Dan
"As you know, tomorrow's
finally the day of my
sister's wedding...{enter}
So, what I want to talk
to you about is exactly
that... Alice's marriage!"

#### 34 ####
Dan
"Fei, to be perfectly
honest with you...{enter}
I've always wished
you could have been
my brother."

#### 35 ####
Dan
"It's still not too late.{enter}
You could go steal Alice
and run off with her!{wait:14}
If you need me to help,
I'd be glad to!"

#### 36 ####
Dan
"It may be odd for me to say
this, but my sister's
beautiful and a good cook...{enter}
(and this is just between
you and me but, she's
well endowed too!{wait:14} 
Heh heh heh!)"

#### 37 ####
Dan
"So c'mon! Go for it!
    Let's do it!!
    That's crazy 

#### 38 ####
Dan
"Really!?
I knew I liked you, Fei!
That's the spirit!"

#### 39 ####
Dan
"... But, if only
it was that easy...{enter}
It's not like we can
change their feelings...{wait:28}
And you would need to
have love for her too..."

#### 40 ####
Dan
"But, I'm not gonna
forget this, Fei!{enter}
You were really willing to
go that far to help me...
Fei, you're a good guy!"

#### 41 ####
Dan
"Tch, yeah I know that.
Well if you're gonna be
like that..."

#### 42 ####
Dan
"But, if you change your
mind, come and talk to
me!"

#### 43 ####
That Dan...!
When will he ever grow up!?

#### 44 ####
Oh, Fei!{wait:14}
Maybe you can help...
Have you seen Dan?

#### 45 ####
Oh really?
I'm a little suspicious
though...{enter}
Alice was saying she needed
him for something...{wait:0F}
I bet he's avoiding me...

#### 46 ####
Alice was saying she needed
him for something...{enter}
How could a brat like
him possibly be related
to Alice?{wait:0F}
Oh, brother...!

#### 47 ####
You're right! I've got my
whole life ahead of me!{wait:14}
I've got to strive harder
to fulfil my goals in life.

#### 48 ####
Sigh...{wait:14} The never ending
hardships of a woman.

#### 49 ####
Alice and Timothy's
wedding tommorow is
the talk of the town.{enter}
I guess it's to be
expected though...{wait:14}
It is one of life's
biggest events.

#### 50 ####
The women of the village
are born, raised, married
and live out the rest of
their lives here.{enter}
There must be some
happiness in that, but...{wait:18}
I've been thinking from
time to time.{enter}
Sometimes I wish I were
born a man so I could
travel the world and live
an ever-changing life...

#### 51 ####
Heh... It's weird, isn't it?{wait:0C}
    Yeah, that is weird!
    No, of course not! 

#### 52 ####
Ooooooh! You think so?{wait:14}
Maybe I need to rethink
this...

#### 53 ####
Really? Do you mean it?{wait:1E}
Hah, I knew you'd say
that for me, Fei.{enter}
Here, this is my very
own homemade Aquasol.
Our bearcows love it!{wait:14} 
Try it out sometime!

#### 54 ####
Received Aquasol, the
choice of all bearcows.

#### 55 ####
Hello, Fei.
Tomorrow is Alice and
Timothy's big day.{enter}
Isn't it exciting!
I know Alice will
make a lovely bride.{enter}
Ahh... I hope a
handsome prince comes
into my life soon.

#### 56 ####
Hey! Stop pushing!{wait:1E}
What are you...some
kind of pervert!?{clear:3C}

#### 57 ####
That doctor is weird!{wait:14}
Why would anyone want to
live up on that mountain
peak?{enter}
He should live closer to
the village...{enter}
Hey, you're good friends
with the doctor.{wait:14} Why
don't you ask him to move
closer to the village!

#### 58 ####
Lately, my legs have
gotten weaker...{wait:14}
It's causing me a great
deal of trouble.{enter}
I would like to go and
have Doctor Uzuki take
a look and see if he
can help me...{enter}
But it's a tremendous task
to go up that mountain path
to visit the doctor.{wait:14}
I must be getting old...

#### 59 ####
That doctor's eccentric!{wait:14}
Why else would anyone
live up on a mountain
peak like that?{enter}
He should have moved
closer to the village!{enter}
Fei, you're good friends
with the doctor...{wait:14}
Ask him to move closer
to our village for us!

#### 60 ####
Lately, my legs have been
giving me trouble.{wait:14}
It's really getting to me!{enter}
I would like to go and have
Doctor Citan Uzuki take a
look at them and tell me
what's wrong...{enter}
But it's a dreadful chore
to climb that mountain path
to visit the doctor.{wait:14}
It must be a sign of my age.

#### 61 ####
Uuh... Sob...{wait:0A}
How could Alice go and get
married...{wait:1E}and to that
muscle head, Timothy...!!{enter}
I...{wait:14}I've loved her...{wait:14}
since I was a baby...!!{wait:14}{enter2}
What am I supposed to do?
How am I supposed to live!?

#### 62 ####
{slow:02}AAAAAARRRRRGGGGHHH!!{fast:00} {clear:78}

#### 63 ####
Sob...{wait:1E} Life...
can be so unfair...

#### 64 ####
Uh... Sob...{wait:14}
Woe is me...!

#### 65 ####
Zzzzzz, snore...

#### 66 ####
Uh, uhn...?{wait:14}
Oh, it's you Fei!
What do you want?

#### 67 ####
Finally, at my age,
I've become able to
live in peace.{enter}
At this rate, I'll
probably live to be
a hundred! Hahahah!

#### 68 ####
No, no!{wait:14}
Don't waste perfectly
good food like that!{clear:32}

#### 69 ####
Fei!!{wait:0A}
I thought I told you
not to step on my food!{clear:3C}

#### 70 ####
You know you won't come out
in one piece if you try and
pull anything on the bride!

#### 71 ####
Why, hello Fei.
Are you here
to see Alice?

#### 72 ####
Actually, it's customary
that we don't let any men
in to see the bride today...{wait:28}
But, you can be an exception.

#### 73 ####
Welcome to the village
of Lah...{wait:28}
Oh, it's you, Fei!?

#### 74 ####
Oh, don't worry...
We already consider
you a proud member of
the Lahan community!{enter}
So, how about finding a
wife and settling down
in our village too?{enter}
I'm sure if you live a
peaceful life here your
memory will be bound to
come back one day.

#### 75 ####
You have a natural ability
to paint and can do martial
arts rather well, I hear!{wait:14}
I bet it's because your body
remembers these things.{enter}
You'll be able to breathe
a sigh of relief when your
memory returns to you...{wait:14}
And don't you worry!
I'm sure it will!

#### 76 ####
Yo, Fei!
Alice has sure
gotten pretty, huh!{enter}
Come to think of it...
Alice, Timothy and you
were always together.{enter}
I bet you also had a
crush on Alice too, eh?{wait:14}
Am I right? Hahahaha!

#### 77 ####
Oh, hello there, Fei.{enter}
Come to think of it,
it's already been quite
a while since you first
came to our village...{enter}
I take it you still
don't remember anything
prior to your coming
here though?{enter}
It must be terrible
not knowing your true
identity and all...{enter}
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm being rude...{wait:14}
Please don't take it
the wrong way.

#### 78 ####
Sorry.
That's all the
Aquasol I have.{enter}
But I've got plenty of
my special fertilizer.
Ya want some?
Hahaha!

#### 79 ####
Oh alright. Here ya go!

#### 80 ####
Received Aquasol.

#### 81 ####
Oh yeah, I forgot!
Here's some of my
homemade Aquasol!{enter}
I used my special
fertilizer in it so
it should work real
well! Haw-haw-haw!

#### 82 ####
Received Aquasol.

#### 83 ####
Hmmm...{wait:14} Oh I'm just
contemplating what I
should plant next.

#### 84 ####
It's a lot of work just
trying to raise crops.
But it's an excellent
feeling, Fei.{enter}
In this great open land,
new life emerges...{wait:14}
I'm not saying we're
doing it.{enter}
It's just the earth, 
rain and sun combining 
together to nurture 
these striving new lives.{enter}
We're just helping 
them out.

#### 85 ####
Pumpkinberry...
Applelily... radish...
Hmmm,{wait:28} they all seem
good...

#### 86 ####
This is the village
consultant's house.{wait:14}
He can teach you
all kinds of things.{enter}
Before you step outside
of our village, it might
be wise to stop by here
for some advice first.

#### 87 ####
This is the general store.{wait:14}
Although they don't have
much of a selection...{enter}
But then again, we're out
in the country...{wait:14} so we
can't complain{wait:14} (too much).
