"Hey, this is huge.{enter}
What can we do with this?
I doubt you can break it."

#### 2 ####
Bart
"My sensors detect what
appears to be a huge cave
on the other side of here.{enter}
If we could only do some-
thing about this boulder...{wait:1E}
But I doubt we can just
smash it to pieces!

#### 3 ####
Fei
"I guess{wait:1E} we could
try pushing it..."

#### 4 ####
Bart
"Wait, no matter how
you look at it{wait:1E}...{wait:1E}"

#### 5 ####
Bart
"Hey, Fei!{wait:1E}
My sensors are responding
to something.{enter}
There appears to be quite
a large cavern on the
other side of here."

#### 6 ####
Bart
"If we can get rid of this
rock...{wait:1E}but I don't think
it's possible."

#### 7 ####
Bart
"The hydromechanic pipe for
my knee joint is on the
verge of breaking down.{enter}
It's all because of that
fall from the ceiling...
followed by pushing this
mega-colossal boulder.{enter}
It won't be funny if my
Gear malfunctions in a
huge cavern like this."

#### 8 ####
Bart
"I don't like you
very much...{enter}
Damn it!
I'll get you when we
get outta here."

#### 9 ####
Fei
"Looks like even a person
couldn't fit through..."

#### 10 ####
Fei
"Looks like even a person
couldn't fit through..."

#### 11 ####
Fei
"We can get by if we help
each other.{enter}
Let's keep it up so we
can get out of here."

#### 12 ####
Fei
"Your friends won't
come and help us?"

#### 13 ####
Bart
"It'd be a waste of time
waiting.{wait:1E} They probably
won't come."

#### 14 ####
Fei
"But, aren't they your
friends?"

#### 15 ####
Bart
"We believe in a
liberal upbringing.{enter}
They'll think we can
escape by ourselves."

#### 16 ####
Fei
"I wonder if doc
is okay."

#### 17 ####
Bart
"Don't worry about the
man you were with.{enter}
I'm sure our guys saved
him by now."

#### 18 ####
Fei
"..."

#### 19 ####
Bart
"What is it?"

#### 20 ####
Fei
"...{wait:1E}{enter}
We wouldn't have fallen
in here if you had only
listened to me."

#### 21 ####
Bart
"Don't blame it on me!
You should've surrendered
instead of challenging me.{enter}
All I wanted was your
Gear."

#### 22 ####
Fei
"Don't be ridiculous!{enter}
You're the one who blindly
attacked me. What else was
I supposed to do?{enter}
I thought I might die if
I didn't fight you."

#### 23 ####
Bart
"I was taking it easy on
you. Couldn't you tell?{wait:0A}
Then you're a bit dense."

#### 24 ####
Fei
"Don't lie to me.
I know you were serious."

#### 25 ####
Bart
"What! You want some!?
Let's have it out!
Right here!"

#### 26 ####
Fei
"..."

#### 27 ####
Bart
"Wait! Settling it
right here comes first.{enter}
I won't be able to get
anything done until we
settle this once and
for all!"

#### 28 ####
Fei
"I thought you wanted a
truce for now? Getting out
of here should come first!{enter}
Once we're out of here,
then I'll fight you all
you want.{wait:1E} Let's hurry up
and move on out of here!"
