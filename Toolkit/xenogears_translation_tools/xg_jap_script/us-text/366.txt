The angel stood watch as
the night ended. Twilight
nodded off in the arms of
a lost child from 500
years ago...And the Sea
Serpent swallowed the dark.{enter}
A wise gramps taught me
that a looooong long time
ago.{wait:14} Don't know what
it is, though, maybe a spell,
yes maybe it is.

#### 17 ####
Say, I have something
really good to tell you,
I could let you in on it.{wait:14}
It's a deal you can't
refuse!

#### 18 ####
Do you wanna know?{wait:14}

Hmm...
I see...
You wanna know, yes you
do...{enter}
Alright,{wait:14} I'll tell you
about the inspirational
tradition of the Chu-chu
Tribe, yes I will.

#### 20 ####
Loooong long ago, the
Chu-chu Tribe had a great
big guardian god, who could
step over huge mountains in
one step. The Wondrous
Mambo god, yes he was!{enter}
The Chu-chu Tribe and the
Wondrous Mambo god lived
happily together in perfect
peace, yes we did.{wait:14} A dreamy
sweet existence.{enter}
But one day, a huuuge red
fireball rained down from
the sky, and blew away our
guardian god as he was
asleep.{wait:14} Blam, kablam, boom!{enter}
But don't worry!{wait:14}
The great big guardian god
became a star in the sky!{wait:14}
He protects the Chu-chu
Tribe, yes he does!!

#### 21 ####
Yes, yes, it's a great
story...{wait:14}No matter how
many times I listen to
it, I'm so moved...yes
I do... {enter}
Be careful now, remember:
Bad guys that pester the
poor Chu-chus will get
punished by our guardian
god, yes they will.

#### 22 ####
Hmm ooh...{wait:14}
I see,
you want to listen...{enter}
Wha?{wait:1E} No?
You don't wanna listen?{wait:14}
Are you sure?{enter}
I see. Too bad.{wait:14}
It really is a great
story...yes it is...

#### 23 ####
I hear the Sage in Shevat
did some research on the
Chu-chu Tribe's tradition,
yes he did.{enter}
That's a lot of work.{wait:14}
Even the old generations
of the Chu-chu Tribe don't
know many things about it.

#### 24 ####
There is a rumor that
the secret room of the
Sage of Shevat is hidden
somewhere in this town.{wait:14}
I wonder if it's true?

#### 25 ####
They're so beautiful.{wait:14}
These are wonderful things
that nobody else sells,
yes they are.{enter}
But this's a very important
treasure of the Chu-chu,
so I can't sell it to you.{enter}
Sooorry. Please go to the
counter if you'd like to
buy something. Thank you, 
thank you.

The guys in Solaris
pestered the Chu-chu Tribe
who'd lived on this star
from the beginning.{enter}
So gramps and grandmas
escaped with the people
from Shevat, yes they did.{enter}
But most of the Chu-chus
couldn't escape and were
killed...{wait:14}Those guys ate
them, yes they did...{enter}
That reminds me...{wait:1E}
I'm hungry, yes I am...{wait:14}
I just remembered I
haven't had lunch yet.

#### 37 ####
Forget the guardian god
of legend. Nobody believes
such fairy tales in this
day and age...no, no.

#### 38 ####
If a great big guardian
god existed, he'd have
beaten Solaris to death a
loooong time ago, yes he
would.

#### 39 ####
Just a bunch of
optimistic, happy guys...
What are we to do about
them...

#### 40 ####
I hope everyone
understands each other,
and lives happily together
someday...yes, I do.

#### 41 ####
Oh, I want to go down to
the land and live with
other people, yes, I do!!

#### 42 ####
I like people in Shevat
because they're all nice.{wait:14}
They treat Chu-chus the
same as themselves...yes,
they do.{enter}
But I heard people on the
land are all scary.{wait:14}
They lie, say awful
things, hurt and kill
each other...

#### 43 ####
I am wrong, right? They
are all nice people, right?{wait:14}
    Everyone's nice.
    Not necessarily...

#### 44 ####
I knew it!{wait:14}
I want to go down to the
land and live with other
people, yes, I do!

#### 45 ####
I see...{wait:14}I hope everyone
understands each other,
and lives happily together
someday...yes, I do.

#### 46 ####
You're awfully straight
forward. I like it.{wait:14}

You smell like soil and
trees, yes, you do.{enter}
Looooong ago, the Chu-chu
Tribe lived in the woods,{wait:14}
with no interference,
yes they did.{enter}
I wonder if someday, we
could ever return to the
land and live in the
woods again...?

Do you want to go down?{wait:0A}
    Yes
    No
