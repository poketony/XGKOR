Welcome to the Tutorial Mode.
Here you can learn more about
the 'Battling' controls.

#### 45 ####
Choose a topic to learn about
and press the ¡Á Button.

#### 46 ####
Battling is a game where you
fight one-on-one with Gears
in a wide-open, circular
field or arena.{enter2}
A match ends when either you
or your opponent's Gear takes
too much damage and has its
Durability (H.P.) reach zero.

#### 47 ####
The game is played on
a screen that displays
the two Gears side on.

#### 48 ####
This is the Gear you control.
You start the battle on the
left-hand side of the screen.

#### 49 ####
This is your opponent's Gear.

#### 50 ####
These are Durability Gauges
that show your damage level.
The top gauge is yours, and
the bottom is your opponent's.{enter}
When you attack your opponent,
his Gear's Durability will be
depleted. The Durability in
the gauge cannot be recovered.{enter}
The one who deplete's his
opponent's Durability Gauge
(H.P.) to 0 first will become
the match winner.

#### 51 ####
This is your Heat Gauge.{enter}
It indicates the temperature
of your Gear, which is raised
when you use your Dash ability
or fire Ether Bullets.{enter2}
Your Gear's temperature can
be recovered also, and this
too will be reflected by the
gauge's level.

#### 52 ####
This is your opponent's
Heat Gauge.

#### 54 ####
When you use Ether Bullets or
your Dash ability, your Heat
Gauge will increase. You have
to avoid heating up too much!{enter}
The gauge will recover when
you're using normal attacks
or just doing nothing at all.
{enter2}
Even during your normal
running movement it will
slowly drop back down.
{enter}
If you use your Ether Bullets
and Dash abilities too much,
the rate of heat recovery
won't be able to keep up...{enter2}
If your Heat Gauge reaches its
limit, your Gear will start to
overheat...
{enter2}
At this point, any further use
of such abilities will damage
your Gear and cause your
Durability (H.P.) to decrease.

#### 55 ####

#### 55 ####
When the indicator alongside
of your Heat Gauge is blue,
you can use Ether Bullets and
Dash abilities as per normal.{enter2}
But, if you use these
abilities while the
indicator is yellow...
{enter2}
your Heat Gauge will exceed
its limit and your Durability
Gauge (H.P.) will decrease.
{enter2}
When the indicator is red,
you have no Durability (H.P.)
left and so cannot fire any
more Ether Bullets.

#### 56 ####
One strategy is to attack your
opponent as much as you can
while you still have
Durability (H.P.) to spare.

#### 57 ####
To approach your opponent,
press the Directional Button
towards him/her.{enter}
To retreat from your opponent,
press the Directional Button
away from him/her.{enter}
Pressing Up / Down on the
Directional Button will move
you away from / towards the
screen respectively.{enter}
Push the ¡÷ Button to jump.

#### 58 ####
Hold down the ¡ð Button while
moving to Dash. You will run
at twice normal speed, but
your Heat Gauge will rise.{enter2}
You cannot Dash when your Heat
Gauge is at maximum or when
your Durability (H.P.) Gauge
is low.{enter}
Also, your Heat Gauge will not
decrease during the time spent
in the air when you jump while
Dashing.

#### 59 ####
When you are right in front of
your opponent and you push the
Directional Button away from
him/her...{enter2}
...you can perform a Back-Dash
(momentary back acceleration).
Use this to instantaneously
dodge your opponent's attacks.

#### 60 ####
Moving while in desert areas
raises the Heat Gauge faster
than normal. Acceleration is
not as responsive either.

#### 61 ####
You cannot Dash in the water
areas. Water will also absorb
Ether Bullets, so you cannot
fire while under water.{enter2}
However, the rate of recovery
of your Heat Gauge is a little
better while your Gear is in
the water.

#### 62 ####
You can use the ¡õ and ¡Á
Buttons to attack.{enter}
For example, if you just push
the ¡õ Button once you will
enter an attack sequence.{enter2}
{wait:78}
If you don't push another
button in the meantime, you
will simply execute the ¡õ
Button's attack and finish.{enter}
Now watch what happens if we
push another attack Button
before the first attack's
movement is completed...{enter2}
Either the ¡õ or ¡Á Buttons
is okay, but here we will try
pushing the ¡Á Button after
our initial ¡õ Button attack.{enter2}{wait:78}
... The ¡Á Button's attack
will follow immediately after
the ¡õ Button's attack.
{enter2}
In this way, you can enter up
to three attacks in advance,
and execute them in one swift
sequence.{enter}
The type of attack changes
with the number of times
and order that the ¡õ and
¡Á Buttons are pressed.{enter}
Try combining the attack
buttons in any order that
you like. For example, {enter2}¡õ¡Á¡õ,{wait:78}
{enter2}¡õ¡õ¡õ,{wait:78} {enter2}¡Á¡Á¡õ{wait:78} and so forth.{enter2}
In all, there are 14 different
kinds of attack combinations
for you to try out.
{enter}
You may input up to 3 attacks
before the first attack is
completed.{enter2}
Among your opponents, there
are Gears that can only attack
up to 2 times in sequence.


#### 63 ####
For long range attacks, you
can press the R1 Button to
launch an 'Ether Bullet'.
{enter2}
Ether Bullets have the ability
to track the enemy, but will
dissipate upon contact with
such things as walls or water.{enter}
For each shot launched, the
Heat Gauge will rise markedly.{enter2}
If you're not careful, you
may lose all your Durability
(H.P.) by just continually
firing Ether Bullets.{enter2}
So always keep an eye on
your Heat Gauge, for fear
of losing Durability.
{enter}
If your opponent fires an
Ether Bullet at you, Dash or
jump to avoid being hit by it.{enter2}
Also, if you hit your enemy's
back while he/she is fleeing,
you may be able knock him/her
off his feet.

#### 64 ####
There are times when you can't
dodge your opponent's attack
by simply moving out of the
way.{enter2}
In those occasions, it is best
to use the L1 Button to guard
against enemy attacks.
{enter}
If you're about to be hit by
your enemy and you don't think
you can dodge it...{enter2}
then press the L1 Button to
take a guarding stance.{enter2}
If you were able to guard
yourself in time, the damage
from your opponent's attack
will be halved.{enter}
However, you cannot guard
yourself against attacks
that come from behind you.{enter}
It may be difficult to use at
first, but when you get used
to it, guarding will probably
become a useful tactic.
