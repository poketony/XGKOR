"We've got sonar.
...{wait:0A}...{wait:0A}{enter}
That's not it. This
type...It matches with
the Aveh pirate ship,
Yggdrasil."

#### 2 ####
Dominia
"Yggdrasil?
Wasn't she sunk in 
another battle?"

#### 3 ####
"There's no record of
its sinking. We were too
busy fighting that red
Gear to try to confirm it."

#### 4 ####
Dominia
"Then, there is a chance
that it did not sink...{enter}
I believe the data shows
the Yggdrasil was the
carrier for that Gear."

#### 5 ####
"One moment{wait:1E}...{wait:1E}...{wait:1E}
Yes, that is correct."

#### 6 ####
Dominia
"Excellent.
Give me the controls."

#### 7 ####
"Excellent?
What are you planning on
doing?"

#### 8 ####
Dominia
"Sink it, of course.
She will never trouble the
Commander again."

#### 9 ####
"Wait. The Commander's
orders were to investigate
the disappearance of that
flying battleship. {enter}
We can't deviate from 
our mission.{enter}
Besides, we are low on
fuel and need to refuel."

#### 10 ####
Dominia
"We have enough.
I'll take her down."

#### 11 ####
"...Groan... Once you
start, there is no
stopping you is there?{enter}
I hope you know that
fighting in water is
totally different than
fighting on land."

#### 12 ####
Dominia
"Of course. Sorry,
Kelvena."

#### 13 ####
Bart
"Dammit! I can barely
maneuver and you're movin'
all over the place..."

#### 14 ####
Fei
"Looks like you're having
a tough fight, Bart."

#### 15 ####
Bart
"Fei!?
You're alive!?"

#### 16 ####
Fei
"Hey, that's my line."

#### 17 ####
Elly
"What about that Gear?"

#### 18 ####
Dominia
"Elhaym!!
What are you doing
here?"

#### 19 ####
Elly
"Dominia!?
Why are you here?"

#### 20 ####
Dominia
"Why? We Gebler need no
special reasons to sink
an enemy ship!{enter}
It is our divine duty to
rule those crass land
dwelling Lambs."

#### 21 ####
Elly
"But why?
How are they different from
us Shepherds, the -Abel- ?"

#### 22 ####
Dominia
"To me -Lambs- and -Abel-
are the same.{enter}
The only definite
differenece is
personal ability.{enter}
The ignorant must
be lead by the wise.
That is our job.{enter}
Look what you've gained
as an Element, Elly.
Why do you even question?{enter}
Your superiority
is obvious!"

#### 23 ####
Elly
"...So the wise harming
the weak is a sign of
ability?{enter}
I didn't want that...{wait:1E}
That's all!!"

#### 24 ####
Fei
"Elly,
are you alright?"

#### 25 ####
Dominia
"That Gear, you're the
one? Hah! So that's how
it is.{enter}
How amusing, Elhaym.
All this for a man?
I guess that story was
true after all.{enter}
You were born of those
lowly Lambs."

#### 26 ####
Elly
"Stop!
Don't say another word!"

#### 27 ####
Dominia
"Hmph, what are you going
to do about it, mongrel!?{enter}
Are you going to use the
power you used in that
incident on me now?{enter}
Go ahead. Show me.
Show me your true power!"

#### 28 ####
Elly
"...I will.{enter}
If you Gebler
are wise...{wait:14}
then {wait:1E}I'd rather
be a fool!!"

#### 29 ####
Dominia
"Then so be it. Then you
shall be dealt with as
the traitor you are."
