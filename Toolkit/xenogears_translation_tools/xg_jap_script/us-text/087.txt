#### 1 ####
Margie!

#### 2 ####
Margie!

#### 3 ####
Margie
"I'm back, everyone!"

#### 4 ####
Oh, Margie...{enter}
We're so glad you're safe...

#### 5 ####
Margie
"Yes, it is all thanks
to Bart and his men."

#### 6 ####
We just received word...{enter}
So we were singing a
hymn of praise and joy.{enter}
We're so happy...
Oh, what a relief!

#### 7 ####
Sister Agnes
"Welcome back, Margie.{enter}
We had faith that you and
your cousin Bart would one
day return safely...{enter}
We and your other friends
have been waiting for you."

#### 8 ####
Margie
"Sister Agnes!"

#### 9 ####
Sister Agnes
"Unfortunately, your
mother and the blessed
Royal Mother..."

#### 10 ####
Margie
"I know, Sister Agnes{wait:05}...{wait:3C}
I heard about it at
the Royal Capital{wait:05}..."

#### 11 ####
Margie
"...But at least I
have made it back...{enter}
I'll never go anywhere,
or leave you from now on!{enter}
I won't make you all worry
anymore...ever again!"

#### 12 ####
Sister Agnes
"Bless you my dear..."

#### 13 ####
Margie
"Sister Agnes, this just
isn't like you at all!{enter}
Here I am back
safe and sound.{enter}
Can't you rebuke
me just a little,
for old time's sake?"

#### 14 ####
Sister Agnes
"Ha...
I'm sorry...{enter}
But I'm just so
happy that I cannot
help but..."

#### 15 ####
"Sister..."

#### 16 ####
Sister Agnes
"...There is no reason
to be so solemnly quiet..."

#### 17 ####
Margie
"...Thank you,
and bless you all!"

#### 18 ####
Margie
"Oh, yes, Sister...{wait:1E}
May I go upstairs?{enter}
It's been oh so long,
so I want to have a look
around up there too."

#### 19 ####
Sister Agnes
"Oh, but of course, dear!{enter}
Don't even think of holding
back from anything...{enter}
Except for one thing...{enter}
Never stay away so long
like that again."

#### 20 ####
Margie
"Ha, ha!
I knew you'd say that.{enter}
Now that's the Agnes
I know!'

#### 21 ####
"Margie, I am so glad."

#### 22 ####
Bart
"It's been a while since
the last time I was here."

#### 23 ####
Bart
"...?{enter}
Something wrong, Margie?"

#### 24 ####
Margie
"...Nothing.{enter}
It's just..."

#### 25 ####
Margie
"I guess I got a 
little emotional...
Heh, heh, heh..."

#### 26 ####
Bart
"..."

#### 27 ####
Bart
"Anyhow, take it
easy for a while.{enter}
...You've put up
with enough, okay."

#### 28 ####
Margie
"...If you are trying to
make me cry, you'll fail."

#### 29 ####
Margie
"Oh yes!{enter}
I'll show Fei and Citan
around our cathedral...{wait:0A}
Follow me!"

#### 30 ####
Citan
"What a strong
girl she is...{enter}
It is obvious that she
really wants to just
break down and cry..."

#### 31 ####
Bart
"Yeah, you're right...{enter}
That's just the way
she has always been.{enter}
For all her talk, she
understands her position
well...{enter}
Maybe there are a few
things I could learn
from her too."

#### 32 ####
Citan
"...How magnificent!"

#### 33 ####
Margie
"If we ever got scolded
for pranks as kids, Bart
and I used to hide here."

#### 34 ####
Bart
"Hey, stop telling
those old stories.
It's embarrassing!"

#### 35 ####
Margie
"But to me, Bart hasn't
changed much since then."

#### 36 ####
Bart
"What!?
You mean that you think
I'm still a kid!?"

#### 37 ####
Margie
"I like the view from
here the best."

#### 38 ####
Citan
"Yes, this is
breathtaking!"

#### 39 ####
Citan
"Light from outside shining
through the stained glass
of the cathedral's front...{enter}
What a brilliant piece of
artistry this is."

#### 40 ####
Margie
"Did you notice that the
two great angels only
have one wing each...?"

#### 41 ####
   According to a legend
  handed down in Nisan...{enter}
  God could have created
    humans perfectly...{enter}
But then, humans would not
 have helped each other...{enter}
So that is what these great
   single-winged angels
       symbolizes...{enter}
 In order to fly, they are
 dependent on one another.

#### 42 ####
Citan
"Ah, so that is the
reason for it.{enter}
I see...{wait:05}
On further inspection,
the left angel looks
somewhat masculine...{enter}
...while the right one
looks somewhat feminine."

#### 43 ####
Citan
"Now that is an unusual
feature, is it not?"

#### 44 ####
Citan
"Usually these depictions
are not gender-specific.{enter}
But these angels are
clearly distinguishable as
having opposing genders."

#### 45 ####
Citan
"And the space between
them is the path from
where god advents..."

#### 46 ####
Citan
"Or could it be the
path leading to god?{enter}
Well...I do not know,
it could be either,
or even both."

#### 47 ####
Citan
"...Now I see!"

#### 48 ####
Citan
"This all coincides with
the teachings of Nisan."

#### 49 ####
Margie
"Ha, ha, ha!
Why Doctor Citan Uzuki!
You are an amusing fellow!"

#### 50 ####
Citan
"Oh!
Excuse me.{enter}
It is a habit of mine..."

#### 51 ####
Fei
"The doc knows a lot
about a lot of things...{enter}
Sometimes I can't even
understand what he's
talking about..."

#### 52 ####
Bart
"...Hah!
Forcing them to fly
together...?{enter}
It would be less
bothersome if they
could fly on their own,
don't you think, Fei?"

#### 53 ####
Margie
"Bart!
You miss the deeper meaning
and beauty of it!"

#### 54 ####
Margie
"Someday I wish I could
be of help to someone
like that..."

#### 55 ####
Margie
"Oh, we haven't visited
the 'Room of Sophia' yet,
have we?{enter}
You're really supposed to
go through some procedures
before you can see it...{enter}
But this time I think it
will be alright if I make
a special exception."

#### 56 ####
Fei
"Sophia?"

#### 57 ####
Margie
"Yes, Sophia.{enter}
She is revered as the
founding mother of the
Nisan nation...{enter}
and the founder of the
Nisan religion who set
forth its teachings.{enter}
There is a special
room upstairs that
has a portrait of
Mother Sophia in it."

#### 58 ####
Citan
"I would definitely like
to view that! Fei, let us
go have a look at it!

#### 59 ####
Margie
"We go up to the gallery
on the second floor from
here..."

#### 60 ####
Sister Agnes
"Well, everyone!"

#### 61 ####
Sister Agnes
"To celebrate the return
of our dear sister Margie...{enter}
and to express our joy to
heaven, let us finish
singing our hymn."

#### 62 ####
(...You must have
been through so much
at the Royal Capital...)

#### 63 ####
No unauthorized persons
   beyond this point.

#### 64 ####
To come here when you
are so young is a sign
of your interest!

#### 65 ####
( ... )

#### 66 ####
Hey, hey!
Don't go up there
like that!

#### 67 ####
I moved from another
town to live here...{enter}
But they say some young
people do the opposite
and move away from here.{enter}
I wonder if it is because
they want something more
than peace in their hearts?{enter}
I guess that is just how
young people are today!

#### 68 ####
My husband was a soldier in
the Royal Capital's army...{enter}
But he died a few years back,
near the border of Kislev.{enter}
Since then, I have been
coming here every year on
the anniversary of his death.

#### 69 ####
I live in the Royal Capital,{wait:1E}
but my oh my...{wait:1E}, this was
definitely worth the trip!{enter}
I never knew it was
so beautiful!

#### 70 ####
Who's that guy you're with?{enter}
What's his problem...!?{enter}
(...{wait:1E} 'castle fetish'!?)

#### 71 ####
Fei
"Huh?{wait:1E}
Ah... Maybe...
{wait:1E}I think."

#### 72 ####
I live in the Royal Capital,{wait:1E}
but my oh my...{wait:1E}, this was
definitely worth the trip!{enter}
I never knew it was
so beautiful!

#### 73 ####
Bart
(Hmm...
Yes you're right!)

#### 74 ####
Fatima Castle is no
comparison to this.

#### 75 ####
Bart
(Hmm...
Yes you're...{wait:3C} What!)

#### 76 ####
Bart
"Hey you!{wait:1E}
Are you putting
down Fatima Castle!?"

#### 77 ####
No, I didn't mean that...

#### 78 ####
Who is this guy!?

#### 79 ####
Fei
"H, hey! Bart!"

#### 80 ####
Bart
"Don't you be dissin' me.
You don't even know
who you're looking at!"

#### 81 ####
Bart
"Damn... Never mind,
just forget it!"

#### 82 ####
I'm on a pilgrimage all
over this country, and
recently traveled to the
Royal Capital area.{enter}
I just got back here a
few days ago, but will
probably be leaving here
again in a few days time.

#### 83 ####
I want to see with my
own eyes what will
become of this country.

#### 84 ####
Preparations should be starting
near the border of this sect's
country for the charge by
the Royal Capital's army.{enter}
But a miscalculated move
directed on the enemy is
certain to backfire
on us, so we'll be taking covert
action for a while.{enter}
I'm on my way there now, but I
thought I'd offer a prayer
before I go.

#### 85 ####
As a matter of fact, the
guy next to me and I were
born here.{enter}
Years ago, we both got
tired of the peaceful but
boring life here, so we
ran away from home.{enter}
But we both ended up
enlisting in the army.{enter}
It's not that we have any
particularly happy memories
or whatever here...{enter}
it's just that, after all,
this is the land of our
birth, so well y'know...
