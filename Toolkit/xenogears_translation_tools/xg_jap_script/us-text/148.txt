Renk
"Hey look, check 
this out..."

#### 2 ####
Stratski
"There's only one
control ship...{enter}
The other 7 are all
Ether guided.{enter}
Just who the hell is
controlling all them?"

#### 3 ####
I never thought you'd
be the escort commander.

#### 4 ####
Elly
"Dominia!?"

#### 5 ####
Helmholz
"...Dominia, who's that?{wait:1E}
Hey, not the one from
the Elements...?"

#### 6 ####
Dominia
"It's been a long time 
Elhaym. The last time
was Jugend, wasn't it?"

#### 7 ####
Elly
"What are you 
doing here?"

#### 8 ####
Dominia
"This is a vital mission,
ordered from central.{enter}
I already have Ramsus'
orders. The Hecht is not
to be piloted by a
common soldier.{enter}
I will take the Hecht."

#### 9 ####
Dominia
"I didn't even need an
escort, but this was
also part of the plan.{enter}
This will be a
good fight."

#### 10 ####
Elly
"Wait! Tell me what our
target is!
You should know."

#### 11 ####
Dominia
"That's restricted...{wait:1E}
but I guess I can tell.{enter}
The electric generator
in the eastern sector of
Kislev's Imperial capital.{enter}
The target is a reactor
left there by an ancient
civilization."

#### 12 ####
Elly
"The reactor!? If you
attack that then Kislev
will..."

#### 13 ####
Dominia
"Probably most of it
will be destroyed.{enter}
The rest will be
uninhabitable
for hundreds of years."

#### 14 ####
Elly
"Why are you doing this?"

#### 15 ####
Dominia
"To purge, why else?
You may know this already,
Kislev has the Gatekeeper.{enter}
The original gate is
controlled by those
vulgar Lambs.{enter}
This land barrier was
made by our predecessors.
The Lambs are trying to
destroy the gate.{enter}
Are you going to
allow that?"

#### 16 ####
Elly
"That may be so...{wait:1E}
but do we have the right
to get involved?"

#### 17 ####
Dominia
"Does that bother you?
Since when did you have
a conscience?{enter}
War, strife, betrayal,
deceit are all that are
on the Lamb's minds.{enter}
Surely you should know
that by looking at the
fools in this country.{enter}
Just let them loose and
see what they'd do.{enter}
They would pillage and
loot our world acting as
if they owned it.{enter}
Advanced knowledge or
tools aren't necessary
for common house pets.{enter}
We must lead them where
they belong."

#### 18 ####
Elly
"You were originally
a land dweller.
So why...?"

#### 19 ####
Dominia
"I was chosen by the
Commander!{enter}
Don't look at
me the same as those
stupid Lambs!"

#### 20 ####
Dominia
"Yes, well...{enter}
You've shirked the duty
that was instilled in you
since your Jugend days.{enter}
Arguing with you is a
waste of time."

#### 21 ####
Dominia
"I was a surface dweller
myself, but I'm going to
purge the -Lambs-.{enter}
I want you, the Shepherds,
-Abel-, to see with your
own eyes what I can do."
