#### 1 ####
It's beyond my ability
to understand, but...{wait:0A}
regardless, I'm counting
on you!{enter}
No one else can do this!

#### 2 ####
We won't see each other
for a while, but I will
pray for your success!

#### 3 ####
We're gonna break up...{wait:0A}is
what I'd like to say but,
at this point, we'll stick
with you to the end!!

#### 4 ####
I didn't think it
really could fly!
Who would've guessed!?

#### 5 ####
(I hope I'll have
a pretty bride!)

#### 6 ####
Let's finish them
in one stroke!!

#### 7 ####
The nurse came looking for
Fei...{wait:0A}
But perhaps the nurse's care
was so bad that Fei ran away!

#### 8 ####
It's more like a monster
ship than a ghost ship...

#### 9 ####
Ghost ship...{wait:0A}
I bet it's one those things
where you get{wait:0A} blood coming
out of the showers...{enter}
Watch out for the shower!

#### 10 ####
Who was that man...?{wait:0A}
I could hear his voice
echo from the hall.

#### 11 ####
What!{wait:0A}
Fei has recovered!?
That's a miracle!!

#### 12 ####
Fei was a nice guy...{wait:0A}
I'll never forget
your kindness...

#### 13 ####
Elly would never do
anything like that!!{wait:0A}
I believe in her...

#### 14 ####
Elly is resting in the
medical room across from
here.{wait:0A} I bet she can't
sleep in a shabby place
like this.

#### 15 ####
Even in a foreign country,
there are people willing
to help.{enter}
I bet this place has an
understanding boss.{wait:0A}
I'm so touched by it...

#### 16 ####
They blame us for destroying
Aveh's troops! I don't get it!{wait:0A}
The explosion of the Gebler
sand cruiser's reactor was to
blame, wasn't it?{enter}
Even if we return to Ignas, we
are just going to be targets
for them!
This sucks!!

#### 17 ####
You were on the Goliath?{wait:0A}
Hey, I tried stopping the
young master, ya know.

#### 18 ####
Professor, we have a big
job to do tomorrow! {enter}
Even if you can't sleep,
you should at least lie
down!

#### 19 ####
(Actually, I'm too excited 
to go to sleep myself...)

#### 20 ####
Marguerite's become
stronger since the
last time I saw her.{enter}
She is indeed the
true Great Mother
of Nisan.

#### 21 ####
Here I go again!

#### 22 ####
We're almost at the base!{wait:0A}
Whew, finally we can rest!

#### 23 ####
I've got to work hard
for my daughter's future!

#### 24 ####
In this mission, the
Yggdrasil won't be able
to act as a lifeboat...{wait:0A}
So be careful!

#### 25 ####
I've never been so
touched since my
daughter was born...{enter}
We've been through
many hardships, and
lost many friends...{enter}
but I now know it
was all for a just
cause!

#### 26 ####
That Shakhan,
better have his
tombstone ready!!

#### 27 ####
We must stay here
for a while...

#### 28 ####
I thought the Gear
left a while ago...{wait:0A}
Didn't it...?

#### 29 ####
That was one huuuge Wels!

#### 30 ####
Ghost ship!?{wait:0A}
Yeesh, now I feel
like a real pirate!

#### 31 ####
Sigurd headed toward the
gun room with some strange
man just a minute ago...{wait:0A}
Sigurd didn't look too happy.

#### 32 ####
I see, I see,{wait:0A}
so you're alright...{enter}
But I wouldn't depend
on the nurse.{wait:0A}
Ha, ha, ha!!

#### 33 ####
What? First the girl,
and now Fei...!?{wait:0A}
This is horrible!

#### 34 ####
Did she lose her temper
and almost destroy the
engine room?{enter}
Young girls these days
just don't know when to
stop!

#### 35 ####
Elly was acting strangely.{wait:0A}
Did she have a fight...?{enter}
Being young is great.{wait:0A}
I used to be like that
when I was your age.

#### 36 ####
We're real 'pirates' at
last.{wait:0A} But, now I kinda
miss life in the sand.

#### 37 ####
Young master, it's a
great feeling to see
a renewed Yggdrasil.{enter}
But it still feels the
same since we only
relocated our habitat.

#### 38 ####
Many of our friends
have passed away...{enter}
We sometimes wonder if
what we're doing is
right, but someday, I
know peace will come!

#### 39 ####
When the young master
becomes a king,{wait:0A} I wonder
if they'll forget about my
bill at the bar in Aveh.

#### 40 ####
They said to stand by
inside the ship.{wait:0A}
But I want to get off at
Nisan.

#### 41 ####
Hey?{wait:0A}
That professor dressed
in green isn't with you?

#### 42 ####
When will I be able to see
my daughter again?{wait:0A}
I guess I'm gonna have to
end this war first...!!

#### 43 ####
My daughter is waiting
for me at the base.{enter}
It's been so long since
I've seen her! So we're
going to spend a lot of
time together.

#### 44 ####
Get enough rest and
be ready for the
decisive battle!

#### 45 ####
Young master, you want to
sleep here, too?{wait:0A} Trust me,
you shouldn't do that...

#### 46 ####
Oh! Are you Rico, the
Battling Champ? I'm
originally from Kislev.
It's great to meet you!!

#### 47 ####
Well, I'm no longer the
Champ.{wait:0A} So there's no
need to get so excited.

#### 48 ####
I may not be so handsome,
but I do have a fiancee
back home...{enter}
but my hometown is Kislev.{enter}
When the young master becomes
the king of Aveh, I wonder
if I'll be able to see her?

#### 49 ####
This is where we rest.
Do you want to rest, too?{wait:0A}
    Yes
    No thanks

#### 50 ####
It's a little messy
so bear with it.

#### 51 ####
See ya.

#### 52 ####
See you later.
Let me know when
you want to rest.

#### 53 ####
My goodness, Bart!
Where is Fei?
You had a fight again?
Oh my...

#### 54 ####
As long as you're alive,
I'll be happy.

#### 55 ####
My goodness, Bart did such
an admirable act!{wait:0A}
He used to be such a
mischievous child...{enter}
When he was young he was
so stubborn! But he had a
strong sense of justice.
I'm so proud of him.

#### 56 ####
I have no idea what Bart
and you are doing, but if
something happens, I'll
back you up! No worries!

#### 57 ####
I've decided to work here,
I hope you don't mind...{enter}
So, have you met my stupid
husband acting all big and
mighty in the engine room?{enter}
He's got a bad mouth, but
deep down he's a good man.

#### 58 ####
I guess there are many
things in the world
I've never seen.{enter}
I'll probably discover
them if I try hard
enough on my own...

#### 59 ####
Her-her-her-her!

#### 60 ####
Helen, so courageous...{wait:0A}
So moving...

#### 61 ####
The Mary card collection...{wait:0A}
I'm having a difficult
time collecting them all...

#### 62 ####
