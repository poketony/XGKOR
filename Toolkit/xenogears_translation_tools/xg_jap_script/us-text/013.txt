#### 2 ####
Fei
"Yeah tomorrow, huh...
Your wedding with Alice!
Now that is a big day!"

#### 3 ####
Fei
"Hey, errh, Timothy.
I just want to thank
both you and Alice...{enter}
3 years ago, I woke up
in this village without
a trace of my memory...{enter}
I didn't know who I was,
where I had been or what
I had been doing up until
that day...{enter}
I couldn't recall a
single thing..."

#### 4 ####
Fei
"Despite that, you and
Alice sympathized with me
and encouraged me to go on.{enter}
If the two of you hadn't
have been there for me,
I don't know what would
have become of me..."

#### 5 ####
Fei
"Timothy...{wait:14}
From the bottom of my
heart, I thank you!{enter}
Now, you and Alice
had better live
happily ever after!"

#### 6 ####
Fei
"Of course!"

#### 7 ####
Fei
"Yeah, sure!
I'll do that...{wait:14} Anyway,
I'll see you later.{enter}
Oh, and I am really
looking forward to the
ceremony tomorrow."

#### 8 ####
Fei
"Why, hello there Dan!{wait:14}
You're lively today...
as you are everyday!"

#### 9 ####
Fei
"What is it, Dan?{wait:14}
It sounds serious!"

#### 10 ####
Fei
"Huh...?{wait:1E} 
What's up with him?"

#### 11 ####
Timothy
"So how was Alice?{wait:1E} I still
can't believe we're really
getting married tomorrow!{enter}
It's such a weird feeling.{wait:1E}
We've always been together
ever since we were just
little kids..."

#### 12 ####
Timothy
"Could you go check up
on Alice for me...?{enter}
The old man and I have
still got to discuss
things with her uncle
and the village chief."

#### 13 ####
Timothy
"Yo! Hi there, Fei.
Sorry for us all using
your house like this.{enter}
But, we have to talk about
the big day tomorrow with
the village chief."

#### 14 ####
Timothy
"Yeah... right...{wait:14}
But it still hasn't hit
me as reality though."

#### 15 ####
Timothy
"Hah! Quit it will ya!
You don't have to go and
get all mushy on me...{enter}
Anyway, to me it feels
like I've always been
friends with you ever
since we were kids."

#### 16 ####
Timothy
"And we will go on being
friends forever, right?"

#### 17 ####
Timothy
"Oh yeah, Fei...
Could you stop by
and check on Alice?{enter}
I still have stuff to
discuss with my old man
and the village chief.{enter}
But I'm sure she'll
be glad to have some
company."

#### 18 ####
Timothy
"Dan!{wait:1E} Don't be so rude.
What's this barging in
and all?"

#### 19 ####
Timothy
"As of tomorrow, I'm
going to be that kid's
brother-in-law...{enter}
Hah!
That part isn't going
to be no honeymoon!"

#### 20 ####
"So there you are!{wait:1E} 
Fei, I have to talk to
you about something!"

#### 21 ####
Dan
"Argh! Timothy's
here too."

#### 22 ####
Dan
"Butt out, Timothy!{enter}
Until you marry my
sister, you have
nothing to do
with me at all!{enter}
I just have some
business here with
my friend Fei!"

#### 23 ####
Dan
"So anyway Fei, I errh...
I have something to talk
to ya about later..."

#### 24 ####
Dan
"Yeah, that's why I can't
talk about it here...{enter}
There's a certain person
listening in who could
cause us trouble...!"

#### 25 ####
Dan
"It's really important!{wait:14}
We gotta talk,{wait:14} seriously,{wait:14}
one-on-one, man-to-man!{enter}
I'll be hanging around
outside. So I'll see
ya there later, OK!"

#### 26 ####
Dan
"Be seein' ya, Timothy!{wait:1E}
Take care of yourself
until tomorrow..."

#### 27 ####
Chief Lee
"Oh, it's you, Fei.{enter}
We're in the middle
of discussing Timothy
and Alice's wedding
arrangements."

#### 28 ####
Chief Lee
"Hey, why don't you bring
a girlfriend or two home
once in a while?{enter}
Just because you live with
an old man like me doesn't
mean you have to hold back
now, you hear!?{enter}
Why, when I was as young
as you are, it seemed like
everyday I would..."

#### 29 ####
Ahem!{wait:14}
Ohum!{clear:28}

#### 30 ####
Chief Lee
"Oh, errh... never mind.{enter}
Now, we still have
important things to
discuss...{wait:14} so don't
get in the way now."

#### 31 ####
Chief Lee
"We still have many
important things to
talk about...{enter}
So you had better
not bother us now."

#### 32 ####
Timothy's Father
"Hello there, Fei.{enter}
Our Timothy is a really
lucky boy to be able to
marry such a beautiful
girl like Alice!{enter}
I hope you come up with
some embarrassing tales
to tell in your speech!
Hah haah haaah!"

#### 33 ####
Alice's Uncle
"I don't know whether to be
happy or sad...{enter}
Tomorrow, our little Alice
is going to become someone's
wife...{enter}
I knew this day would come!{wait:14}
...This is the worst part of
bringing up a little girl!"

#### 34 ####
Sigh...{clear:14}

#### 35 ####
You know Fei, I am sure that
our village chief thinks of
you as his own grandson...{enter}
Not having any family for
all those years, and living
on his own for oh so long...{enter}
That's why he cares so very
dearly about you!

#### 36 ####
Please, never do anything that
would break his poor old heart!{wait:14}
You promise me that, Fei!?
