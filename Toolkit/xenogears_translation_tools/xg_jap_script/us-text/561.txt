#### 1 ####
What's this place...?

#### 2 ####
...What's he done now!?
He only called you in
here for his own sake...

#### 3 ####
This is inside the shell
of your basic character,
the room of the 'coward'.{enter}
I'm sure you've been here
many times before.

#### 4 ####
I see... 
I remember now...
In my dreams...

#### 5 ####
Everything despised and
unwanted he pushed onto me,
while he shut himself up
in his own little shell...
the 'coward' Fei.

#### 6 ####
The basis for our
personalities.

#### 7 ####
Who are you?
...Ah, you're my...

#### 8 ####
Hey...let's watch this
together! This is my most
treasured possession...

#### 9 ####
Hah...! By repeatedly
replaying the times he
was full of happiness
he lives in his own
happy little world.

#### 10 ####
While I'm still alive only
because of what's in those
left over dregs.

#### 11 ####
Here! I'll show you...
'everything' about me.

#### 12 ####
He pushed all the bad
things onto me...
but kept all the memories
filled with happiness and
mother's love to himself.{enter}
And he shut himself away
with those memories
inside his own little
shell{wait:05}...{wait:05}forever.{wait:0A}
This is the place.{enter}
What you see before you,
is what he made.
He just keeps hanging on
to those memories.

#### 13 ####
That's what this is...

#### 14 ####
Stop it!
Just stop it!
This...
These scenes...{enter}
Are these all
there is to us?

#### 15 ####
Enough already!
There is nothing here!
Just a world filled with
deception and pain...

#### 16 ####
It can't be helped.
This is our world...
This is 'everything'...

#### 17 ####
No!
Get out!{enter}
This is my room!{enter}
I thought you would 
always be with me!

#### 18 ####
Why won't you see
reality? {enter}
Happiness... Sadness...
Aren't these all parts that
combined to make the whole?{enter}
Why won't you show him?
Why don't you also show
Id what you always watch!

#### 19 ####
No!
That's mine!{enter}
I don't want to show
it to the person who
killed mother!!

#### 20 ####
You should talk.
You're the one who
killed mother!

#### 21 ####
No I didn't, you did!
I did not kill her!{enter}
Mother didn't care
for you{wait:05}...{wait:05}
Father didn't notice
either{wait:05}...{enter}
That's why you
killed her!{enter}
I didn't kill her!
I didn't!
I didn't...!

#### 22 ####
Knock it off!!

#### 23 ####
...'We' killed mother.
It's no one's fault
but ours.{enter}
It's not because she
became Miang or because
father didn't notice.{enter}
Don't look outside for
the reason. Don't blame
anyone but yourself.{enter}
Yes, mother was Miang,
and I know that you
suffered. No one could
have endured it.{enter}
But you can't push it
onto Id alone.{enter}
We are all one person.
We must all become one.
Right? Fei...

#### 24 ####
Walk on your own two feet!
Face up to the reality that
you don't want to see!

#### 25 ####
Show them to Id.
Everything you took
for yourself...

#### 26 ####
Lies! That woman...
This scene...
All illusions he made up!{enter}
I, my consciousness, can
see through this trick.
I won't be swayed!{enter}
I...! 
I...!

#### 27 ####
Id...that's enough!
Doing that isn't going
to solve anything.{enter}
Mother saved us at
the last moment.
That is the truth.
Right?{enter}
The reality isn't
all grim, Id...

#### 28 ####
My power...
couldn't save anyone.
It only destroyed.{enter}
I thought that I could
only make a connection
with others through
destruction.{enter}
So I had to destroy
it all. People...
The world...{wait:14}
Even Elly...

#### 29 ####
No...
That's not the case.{enter}
We can save others
just as our mother,
despite being Miang,
saved us.{enter}
Our power...
can save people{wait:0A}...{wait:0A}
We can save Elly!

#### 30 ####
...That's a first. 
Mother being so warm...{enter}
To me...
she almost seems...
too warm...

#### 31 ####
Fei.
Take the memories
I have within me.
You must know what
it used to be like
up until now.{enter}
Know our identity...
about who we are.
Then figure out what
ought to be done.{enter}
Our integration is
not yet complete.
