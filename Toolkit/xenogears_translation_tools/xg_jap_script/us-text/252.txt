#### 23 ####
Bart
"What's up?"

#### 24 ####
Bart
"We're near the capital.
It's probably just some
kind of ship from there."

#### 25 ####
Bart
"Under the sand?{wait:10}
This is the only sand
cruiser in all of Aveh!"

#### 26 ####
Bart
"...Alright!
We'll start!
Ready the shuttle boats!"{wait:10}

#### 27 ####
Bart
"When we land,
hide the ship!"

#### 28 ####
Bart
"It's alright,
Old Maison."

#### 29 ####
Bart
"We'll go back to Nisan!"

#### 30 ####
Bart
"Margie and them are still
there. We'll go back!
We have to!{enter}
That reminds me...
What about Fei and his
guys? If they're alright,
we could..."

#### 31 ####
Bart
"Dammit!
This can't be happening!"

#### 32 ####
Bart
"Behind...?"

#### 33 ####
Bart
"Something's coming
from behind!{enter}
Jerico! Give me the helm...

as far as you can!{enter}
Stop the engine!
Crash alarm!!"

#### 38 ####
Stop the engine! 
Crash alarm!!

#### 39 ####
I don't hear anything other
than the flowing sound of
the sand... No suspicious
radar activity detected!

#### 40 ####
Franz
"I don't hear anything
other than the surface
wind waves and our engine.{enter}
Threat is minimal from
looking at the radar
and sonar."

#### 41 ####
Oh...?

#### 42 ####
Franz
"No...for a moment, I
thought I caught some
unnatural sounds..."

#### 43 ####
Franz
"But it's not from the
surface... It's from
under the sand!"

#### 44 ####
Franz
"...I can't catch it again.
It could have been a sand-
whale..."

#### 45 ####
Franz
"There...
On the surface layer!{enter}
I'm detecting sounds of
anchors being weighed
in and engines being
activated!{enter}
The Royal Capital's
defense fleet must
be departing...!"

#### 46 ####
Franz
"We've had no contact
since we confirmed their
order to charge..."

#### 47 ####
Franz
"Aft of our stern! 300!
I'm picking up the sound
of torpedoes being readied!{enter}
A sand cruiser!? It's big!
Speed 60! Relative route
0-0-0! They were hiding
behind some baffles!"

#### 48 ####
Franz
"I'm picking up some high
speed propulsion, breaking
away from the enemy's ship!{enter}
Torpedoes!? Two of them!
Speed 87!
Torpedoes confirmed with
the sonar.{enter}
They've shifted over to
active homing!"

#### 49 ####
Franz
"Torpedo...1, still
pursuing! Dammit!
Impact in 3!!"

Turret A 'Anton' and Turret
B 'Belta'{wait:10} can initiate their
ectropometers twenty seconds
after opening their hatches.

#### 51 ####
Gungany...
No, Bart Missile, fueling!{enter}
It'll take fifteen seconds
from opening the hatch
to engage the illuminator!

#### 52 ####
Alternate firing between
A 'Anton' and B 'Belta'!{wait:10}
Calculating adjustments!

#### 53 ####
Young master!
I'm detecting an increase
in the use of F Band!{enter}
That's the Royal Capital's
defense force's frequency!

#### 54 ####
We also intercepted a
transmission from the
patrol at the border
with Kislev!{enter}
They're requesting
immediate backup from
the Royal Capital!{enter}
Looks like we've
really raised some
hell at the border!

#### 55 ####
Open jammer!
Noisemaker, 2nd, 4th
tube{wait:10}...Standby!

#### 56 ####
But first mate!
Now with the effect-fins out
of order, if you run at full
speed, the ship wouldn't be
able to stand the friction!!

#### 57 ####
First mate!!

#### 58 ####
Y, young master!{wait:10}
What is happening?
What was the alarm
all about...

#### 59 ####
Y, young master!!{clear:60}

#### 60 ####
Maison
"Y, young master!
The Gungany Missiles...{enter}
You need permission from
more than a half of the
crew members to..."{clear:78}

#### 61 ####
Maison
"Y, young master!{wait:10}
What is happening?{enter}
What was the alarm
all about...?"

#### 62 ####
Young master, please wait!
It may just be a
requisitioned ship,
not a warship...

#### 63 ####
Maison
"Y, young master!{enter}
I have an awfully bad
feeling about this{wait:05}...{wait:0A}
Do be very careful!"

#### 64 ####
Maison
"Y, yes...young master...{enter}
I hear when they attacked
the fort at the border,
the Gebler, led by Ramsus,
routed them.{enter}
We'd better withdraw for
now, and reconsider..."

#### 65 ####
Maison
"Young master..."

#### 66 ####
Not again...?
Young master!
Hold on a second!

#### 67 ####
Young master!!{clear:60}

#### 68 ####
Sigurd
"Young master! Again!!?"

#### 69 ####
Sigurd
"Just doesn't know
when to give up..."{clear:60}

#### 70 ####
Sigurd
"We haven't heard anything
about a new ship even from
the spies at Aveh Naval HQ.{enter}
Franz, can you try again
and confirm what it is?"

#### 71 ####
Sigurd
"It's useless!
Young master!"

#### 72 ####
Sigurd
"Young master...?"

#### 73 ####
Sigurd
"Kahr!"

#### 74 ####
Sigurd
"Young master!!!"{clear:20}

#### 75 ####
Sigurd
"Engine, ready for full
power!! Jerico! Give me
the helm over here!"

#### 76 ####
Sigurd
"It can 'jump' due to the
Bernoulli effect on the
wings' surfaces instead!!"

#### 77 ####
Sigurd
"Never mind that!
The Yggdrasil is nothing
without the young master!{enter}
Full power!!
Maximum speed!!"

#### 78 ####
Sigurd
"Eeeeeaaaaarrrrgghh!!!!

Sigurd
"Seems like they're
watching us."
