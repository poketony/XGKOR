Hello, surface people.
Look at this picture.{wait:14}
It's me and my wife a
long time ago.

#### 2 ####
It may be hard to believe
but there was a time when
we were young too,{wait:14}
full of dreams and hopes.{enter}
My wife died two years ago.{wait:14}
So, I asked the people in
the world below to bury
her ashes in the earth.{enter}
My time will also come
soon...{wait:14} Could you young
people bury my ashes in
the earth for me too...?{enter}
I'm tired of...waiting...
and believing...{wait:14}
I want to rest in peace
in the earth.

But I was wondering
what it would be like to
live without getting old
like Queen Zephyr...{enter}
What has she seen,
and heard for the past
500 years?{enter}
Did what she see and
hear really bring her
happiness...?{wait:14}
That, I don't know.

#### 4 ####
This country's been
through a lot.{wait:14}
We no longer have enough
strength to fight Solaris...

#### 5 ####
You people from the
world below should go
to the royal palace.{enter}
Queen Zephyr will listen
to your wishes and show
you the way.{enter}
You may be the new hope
for those who're against
Solaris...

#### 6 ####
Do you want to go down?{wait:0A}
    Yes
    No
