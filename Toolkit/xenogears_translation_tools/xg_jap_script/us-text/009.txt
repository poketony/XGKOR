Fei
"???{wait:14}
What is that?"

#### 2 ####
Fei
"Sea of sand...?"

#### 3 ####
Fei
"Hmmm...{wait:14}
Well, whatever."

#### 4 ####
Fei
"Well then,
thanks for this."

#### 5 ####
Barkeep
"Aaarh, Fei!
That's the back door!{wait:14}
Go around and come in
through the front door!"

#### 6 ####
Barkeep
"Hey, it's Fei.
How's it going?{enter}
I ain't got any drinks
for kids, ya know!{wait:14} 
Come back when you're
older, alright!!?"

#### 7 ####
Barkeep
"Here's a tip, Fei.
Be very cautious of
alcohol and women.{enter}
Behind those sweet and
beautiful appearances
lies a deep, dark swamp.{enter}
Before you realize it,
you are trapped, and
lose your freedom.{enter}
They are the most
fearsome demons
in this world."

#### 8 ####
Barkeep
"Hey, Ellen!{wait:14}
Quit teasing the
innocent kid!"

#### 9 ####
Hmmm...!!{wait:14}
Young one, beware!
I can see it...{enter}
There is a dark and
icy wind that blows
where you are going.{enter}
A wind that nurtures
grief and resentment,
inviting death from
which there is no
salvation...{enter}
No one will be able
to escape from it!
But you, and only you,
must eventually face
up to that dark wind!

#### 10 ####
... Just kidding!{wait:14}
I've always wanted
to try saying that!{enter}
Did I scare you?{wait:0A}
I'm really sorry!
Wahaha...

#### 11 ####
But in reality, these
premonitions of misfortune
tend to take on their own
shape once uttered.{enter}
You ought to be
prepared...{enter}
... Hah hah! Just kidding!{wait:14}
It's also a joke!{wait:14}
Don't let it get to you.

#### 12 ####
Instead of believing
what others say, you
should follow your
own path.{enter}
After all, your
fate will be what
you make of it.

#### 13 ####
But, do you want to hear
my prediction again? Eh?{wait:14}
    Yeah, from the top!
    No, enough already!

#### 14 ####
Oh good!
That's the spirit!
Well, here goes...{wait:14}
Are you ready?

#### 15 ####
How boring.{wait:14}
A guy like you will
never be popular.

#### 16 ####
Gramps always makes
things out to be
easier than they
really are!{enter}
It's actually quite
a tremendous feat
to get through that
Blackmoon Forest...{enter}
All those dangerous
beasts and fearsome
fire-eating lizards
live there...{enter}
I tell you, it's
better if you don't
go near the place!

#### 17 ####
South of here is the
'Blackmoon Forest'.
If you can make it through
there, you'll come to Aveh,
the great land of fire!{enter}
I shouldn't be wasting my
time here in this little
country village.
Why, I oughta go to Aveh
and work there...!{enter}
Beautiful women and good
liquor...{wait:0F}
And if I work hard enough,
I'll be rich in no time!{enter}
Hehehe...
Wouldn't that be good!

#### 18 ####
Pay no attention to
the fool!
He's always saying all
this carefree stuff.{enter}
In reality, it's an
incredibly hard task
to get through the
Blackmoon Forest...{enter}
Lots of dangerous
beasts and fearsome
fire-eating lizards
make their home there!{enter}
It'd be better for
you to stay away
from there!

#### 19 ####
If you get through the
'Blackmoon Forest' to
the south of here, you
will find the kingdom of
fire, 'Aveh'.{enter}
Instead of just wasting
away here in this little
mountain village, I should
go have some fun in Aveh!{enter}
Beautiful girls, tasty
liquor...{wait:0F}
Why, a gentleman like
myself is bound to draw
the babes wherever I go!{enter}
Haw-haw-haw...
Wouldn't that be good!

#### 20 ####
Have you heard the
latest rumors!?{enter}
It's said that, in the
southern desert of Aveh
there is buried treasure
all over the place!{enter}
There's hundreds of
people who are trying
to strike it rich by
digging everywhere!{enter}
A single strike could 
make you totally rich.

#### 21 ####
But then again, you
never can tell how
much is the truth...{enter}
In life, if it sounds
too good to be true,
it usually is. Bah.

#### 22 ####
You gotta problem with
me{wait:05}, hic,{wait:05} drinkin' at
midday?{wait:14} How can I not be
drinkin'{wait:05}... Damn it...

#### 23 ####
Nobody knows...{wait:0A}
In the depths...{wait:0A}
of the sea...{wait:0F}
a tear...drop...{wait:0F}
shed by...{wait:0F}
a mermaid...{enter}
It's not some dream...
You idiots...{wait:14}
Hic...

#### 24 ####
You got a problem, boy?{wait:14}
    No... Go, go, go for it!!
    Yeah... I hate drunks!
    Drinking won't help matters!

#### 25 ####
Hya hah hah...
I like you, boy!{wait:14} Now go
away and leave me alone.

#### 26 ####
Hah!
The feeling's mutual...{enter}
I hate nosy people!
Since we both hate each
other, why don't you just
leave me alone then, eh?

#### 27 ####
Shut up! 
What would you know!?{enter}
You don't know how I
feel.{wait:14} I wouldn't want
you to know.{wait:14} Damn it...

#### 28 ####
No...{wait:0F}
Wait up, boy!

#### 29 ####
I'll give you this.{wait:14}
Take it.

#### 30 ####
I have no use for it...{wait:14}
Don't worry 'bout it.
Just take it.

#### 31 ####
Nobody knows...{wait:14}
In the depths...{wait:0F}
of the sea...{wait:0F}
a tear...drop...{wait:19}
shed by...{wait:0F}
a mermaid...

#### 32 ####
Received a 'Mermaid Tear'!

#### 33 ####
My, that drunk had the
most beautiful stone!{wait:14}
Hmmm...
I wonder what it was?

#### 34 ####
Welcome, Fei.
You wanna have some fun?{wait:14}
I give the best service
in Lahan, you know!?

#### 35 ####
Oh my! Welcome Fei...
You wanna have some fun?
I give the best service
in Lahan, you know!?

#### 36 ####
Yeah, yeah! I know!{wait:14}
It's just a joke...
you blockhead!

#### 37 ####
Gee, he's got sharp
hearing!{wait:14} Anyway...{enter}
(Maybe next time, okay,
Fei!?{wait:14} I'll be waiting...{wait:0E}
Rowrrr!)

#### 38 ####
(Maybe next time, okay,
Fei!?{wait:14} I'll be waiting...{wait:0E}
Rowrrr...)

#### 39 ####
There he goes again...{wait:14}
How could there be a
mermaid in the middle
of the sea of sand?

#### 40 ####
What's this, Fei?
You've never seen
the sea of sand?{enter}
This is what the
sea of sand is...
It's a vast, swirling,
bottomless desert.{enter}
More than half the world
is this sea of sand.{enter2}
I'm surprised you haven't
heard anything about it.
