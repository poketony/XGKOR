"What is the matter,
young master...?"

Bart
"My good people of Aveh...{enter}
This is Bartholomew Fatima
the 19th king of Aveh,
son of Edbart Fatima IV
the 18th king of Aveh.{enter}
First, one must apologize
for the trouble caused by
one's unavoidably lengthy
absence from the palace.{enter}
One especially wants to
give one's condolences to
those who lost family in
the war with Kislev.{enter}
One will immediately call a
truce with Kislev and begin
reparations to victims of
both countries.{enter}
All citizens drafted as
soldiers will also be
allowed to return home.{enter}
Let us work together
towards the rebuilding
of Aveh!"

Bart
"...One also has
another final but
important message...{enter}
A declaration from the
will of Edbart IV who
wished only for peace
for his kingdom, Aveh.{enter}
I Bartholomew Fatima, 
the 19th King of Aveh,
do hearby declare...{enter}
from this day forward
I shall abandon the
monarchy and create
the Republic of Aveh!"

"What in Aveh 
are you doing...?"

Bart
"This is my father's wish.{enter}
I am sorry. You both have
worked so hard for many
long years to restore me
to the throne.{enter}
Now I'm no longer in line to
be king, nor anything else
for that matter, the two of
you are free to go."

#### 10 ####
Maison
"What are you saying...?"

#### 11 ####
Sigurd
"Unbelievable."

#### 12 ####
Maison
"Master Sigurd?"

#### 13 ####
Sigurd
"Can't you hear the 
crowd outside?{enter}
They have chosen you as
their king. You're going
to be very busy."

#### 14 ####
Bart
"Sig..."

#### 15 ####
Sigurd
"Won't you need some
capable assistance?"

#### 16 ####
Bart
"Well...here goes 
nothing."
