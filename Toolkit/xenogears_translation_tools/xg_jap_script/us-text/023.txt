{fast:FF}Fei
"Elly!!"

#### 2 ####
Fei
"Yeah...I guess so."

#### 3 ####
Citan
"That fight with the
Rankar was remarkable.{enter}
An ordinary Gear could
not defeat that monster.
And you certainly keep
yourself in good shape..."

#### 4 ####
Fei
"Why did you bring
this here, doc?"

#### 5 ####
Citan
"This...?
You mean {name:0B:¥ô¥§¥ë¥È©`¥ë}?"

#### 6 ####
Fei
"...{name:0B:¥ô¥§¥ë¥È©`¥ë}?{wait:14}
This is the Gear that
destroyed our village.{enter}
Why did you bother
bringing it here?
I never want to see
another Gear again..."

#### 7 ####
Citan
"I understand how
you must feel...{enter}
But, in order to
protect yourself
you need a certain
degree of strength.{enter}
Even more since we
are being pursued."

#### 8 ####
Fei
"I agree that a certain
degree of strength is
needed for self-defense.{enter}
And if it weren't for this
Gear here, Elly and I'd be
in that Rankar's stomach
right now...{enter}
But its power goes beyond
what is necessary. Does
one really need the power
to destroy everything?"

#### 9 ####
Citan
"..."

#### 10 ####
Fei
"I don't need that
kind of power...
I just hate Gears."

#### 11 ####
Citan
"Fei, using power or being
used by power...is that not
a problem of the heart...?{enter}
If humans do not use their
power for wrong it can be
a good thing...I believe
such power can help us.{enter}
In that respect, I know
you will be fine.
It sure helped you out
this time.{enter}
Am I right?"

#### 12 ####
Fei
"I want to believe that.
But something is holding
me back. This Gear..."

#### 13 ####
Fei
"Well, whatever...
At least Elly is
safe now."

#### 14 ####
Citan
"She seems to
have come to."

#### 15 ####
Elly
"Huh...?"

#### 16 ####
Citan
"I am Citan...
a friend of Fei's.{enter}
You almost did not make it.
If Fei had not have helped
you, I hate to think what
may have happened.{enter}
But I was not too pleased
with his rashness in trying
to take on that Rankar
with just his bare fists."

#### 17 ####
Elly
"Bare fists?"

#### 18 ####
Citan
"Well, I am glad that you
were able to find a use
for what I brought you."

#### 19 ####
Elly
"!!"

#### 20 ####
Citan
"Let us just say we are
borrowing what the Kislev
army left behind..."

#### 21 ####
Elly
"...Oh."

#### 22 ####
Elly
"Thank you, Fei.
This makes twice."

#### 23 ####
Fei
"Don't mention it.
I'll just put it
on your tab."

#### 24 ####
Citan
"It is getting dark.
Let us make camp now and
start out early tomorrow.{enter}
The both of you look tired
and I need to make some
repairs on our friend
here..."

#### 25 ####
?{clear:1E}

#### 26 ####
Elly
"Why did I go and
say that to him...?"{clear:3C}

#### 27 ####
Elly
"Yes...
that's right...
I am a coward..."

#### 28 ####
{fast:FF}!?{clear:14}

#### 29 ####
Citan
"Fei!
Are you alright?"

#### 30 ####
Fei
"Has Elly gone yet?"

#### 31 ####
Citan
"Oh, so you were awake?"

#### 32 ####
Fei
"Yes, I woke up midway, so
I only heard part of what
you two were discussing."

#### 33 ####
Citan
"..."

#### 34 ####
Fei
"Elly...
so that's what she is?"

#### 35 ####
Citan
"Fei, she is..."

#### 36 ####
Fei
"I know. 
It's not Elly's fault.{enter}
What happened to the
village is all my fault.{enter}
I took out all my pent up
feelings on Elly. I'm the
one who should apologize."

#### 37 ####
Citan
"Fei, do not blame 
yourself. It was not 
your fault either.{enter}
You were just trying to
protect the village."

#### 38 ####
Fei
"Thanks, doc...
By the way, how is everyone
from the village going?"

#### 39 ####
Citan
"Do not worry, Yui is
taking care of them.{enter}
I told her to leave soon
and take them all to a
certain place.{enter}
They should be safe for a
while. So you just worry
about yourself for now."

#### 40 ####
Fei
"Okay, doc."

#### 41 ####
Citan
"Now to think what we
should do next...{enter}
Shall we leave this forest
and head for the desert
town of Dazil?{enter}
We may learn what Aveh and
Kislev are up to...
not to mention getting some
parts for {name:0B:¥ô¥§¥ë¥È©`¥ë}.{enter}
The leader of Aveh is not
going to sit back and let
the other night's fiasco
go by unpunished!"

#### 42 ####
Fei
"What is that...?"

#### 43 ####
Citan
"I would assume it is
an aerial battleship
from Aveh..."

#### 44 ####
Fei
"An aerial battleship?
I've never heard of Aveh
having anything like that."

#### 45 ####
Citan
"Of course it does
not come from Aveh
originally...{enter}
Most likely it belongs
to the Gebler forces
stationed in Aveh."

#### 46 ####
Fei
"Gebler?"

#### 47 ####
Citan
"Special forces from the
Sacred Empire of Solaris
known as Gebler.{enter}
I am sure you have heard
something about them.{enter}
They are an organization
providing large scale
military aide to the
Kingdom of Aveh.{enter}
They showed up in Ignas
several months ago.
Until then, Aveh was
being routed by Kislev.{enter}
But with Gebler's help
they have managed to
regain half their loses.{enter}
They are now expanding
their territory and
gathering resources
buried in the ruins."

#### 48 ####
Fei
"I've heard the village
elders talk about it...{wait:1E}
Is Elly a part of that?"

#### 49 ####
Citan
"Quite possibly so.
Their group has superior
technology and power.{enter}
It is rumored they are
here solely to get the
resources in the ruins.{enter}
I am surprised they are
using something as
powerful as that ship...{enter}
It must be to supress the
recent border skirmishes."

#### 50 ####
Fei
"So they are fighting
the Kislev Empire?"

#### 51 ####
Citan
"Yes. It seems they have
found new ruins on the
northern edge of Aveh.{enter}
Those ruins are under a
five-hundred-year-old
temple.{enter}
Three weeks ago Kislev
took over those ruins.
Most likely they are
fighting over that."
