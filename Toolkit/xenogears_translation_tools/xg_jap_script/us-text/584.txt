I don't know why but
recently, families
keep increasing.

#### 2 ####
I wasn't planning on living
here,{wait:3C} but my son's family
is with me.

#### 3 ####
I never thought I'd live
here...{wait:32}I wanted to make
my parents happy.

#### 4 ####
After losing our home in
Kislev...we lost our home
in Aveh, too. So we decided
to stay here for a while.{enter}
But next time, I want to
live somewhere that's green.

#### 5 ####
It's not bad. There are
a lot of people, and it's
fun to play in the snow.

#### 6 ####
I like this house because
there are lots of cats!

#### 7 ####
This isn't bad at all
compared to military camp
and the cat house.

#### 8 ####
We had a hard time
evacuating because my
daughter begged us to take
all the cats with us.

#### 9 ####
It's tremendously lonely
without cats.
