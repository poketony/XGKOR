#### 1 ####
How old was I...?{wait:0A}
I don't remember.
Maybe 8 or 9. {enter}
About then,
dad taught me
how to use a gun.

#### 2 ####
One day
dad disappeared.

#### 3 ####
He just ran out on us.

#### 4 ####
He never came back.

#### 5 ####
Even so,
I stayed in his room alone
often.{enter}
Dad's gun,{wait:0A} 
Dad's smell.{wait:0A}{enter}
Those things were all
I had left to
remind me of him.

#### 6 ####
But that happiness 
didn't last long...

#### 7 ####
When I was 12,
my house was attacked
by Reapers
and mom was killed.{enter}
They were looking for dad
but mom wouldn't talk.

#### 8 ####
I can still hear it...{wait:0A} 
The sound of the bullets
slowly firing three times...{enter}
I even remember the sound
of the empty shells
hitting the floor.{enter}
After that,
the Reapers screamed
and I heard someone fall.

#### 9 ####
Bishop Stone was the one 
who helped us then.{wait:0A}{enter}
Meeting him changed my life
from then on.

#### 10 ####
Bart
"Hey, hey, wait a sec.{wait:0A} 
Do Reapers talk?"

#### 11 ####
Citan
"Wait a minute.{wait:0A} 
Reapers spoke in a human
language?"

#### 12 ####
"Yes.{wait:0A}
They're not just monsters.
Some of them are more
intelligent than humans."

#### 13 ####
Primera and I hid in the
shadows escaping death,
but she hasn't spoken a
word since. 

#### 14 ####
Like a godsend, kind,
strong Bishop Stone gave
me an example to follow.{enter}
I wanted to help save
someone in need like
he saved us.{enter}
I didn't want there to
be any more children
like Primera...{enter}
So I began training at the
'Ethos' to become just
like Bishop Stone.

#### 15 ####
I left Prim in the care
of the 'Ethos' and
entered the monastery.

#### 16 ####
Many years passed...

#### 17 ####
I finished training
at the monastery and
became an Etone.

#### 18 ####
I returned home to
open the orphange...

#### 19 ####
And he...{wait:0A}had
unexpectedly come back.

#### 20 ####
But he was different.{wait:0A}
Some terrible accident
changed him. {enter}
Not only his looks, but
his character and manner
had entirely changed too.{enter}
I remembered him as a
quiet man...

#### 21 ####
But...{wait:0A} more than that,
I thought maybe I didn't 
really remember him...

#### 22 ####
That's why...{wait:0A}
I can never think of him
as a father...

#### 23 ####
But Prim needed a father, 
and she'd become attached
to him.{enter}
Deep in my heart, I too
thought I wanted a father.

#### 24 ####
But...{wait:0A}
even now I just can't 
believe he is my real 
father.

#### 25 ####
Stone
"4 years ago...
After searching to the ends
of the earth, no trace of
him could be found."

#### 26 ####
Stone
"Racquel, dirtied by
him{wait:05}...{wait:05}{enter}
and the reminder of that
taint...{wait:1E}you and
your sister{wait:1E}..."

#### 27 ####
Stone
"Through Krelian's wisdom,
using the Wels, I saved
Racquel from misery..."

#### 28 ####
