Fei
"Lahan...I like it.{enter}
The village leader,
Chief Lee, has taken
such good care of me...{enter}
Everyone in the village
has warmly accepted
me..."

#### 2 ####
Fei
"Regardless of where I may
have been born and raised,
Lahan is now my home."

#### 3 ####
Fei
"I don't dislike Lahan.{wait:14}
The people here are good
people."

#### 4 ####
Fei
"But, someday, I'd really
like to leave and find my
true home...{enter}
To walk upon the land I
was born on, I want to meet
those who've known me...{enter}
I want to know who
my true self is."

#### 5 ####
Fei
"As it is now, it feels
like there's some kinda
empty void within me..."

#### 6 ####
Fei
"Of course.{wait:14} 
I'd never forget."

#### 7 ####
This town may be hidden
away deep within the
mountains without anything
else...{wait:14} But, I still love
it...Lahan.

#### 8 ####
Well if it isn't Fei.{wait:14}
Isn't it exciting to know
that Timothy's wedding is
going to be tomorrow?{enter}
I think it's time you
found a wonderful girl
like Alice yourself.
Hah hah.

#### 9 ####
By the way, Fei. What
do you think of Lahan?{wait:14}
    I like it
    I don't dislike it...

#### 10 ####
Ah, yes.{wait:14} It makes me
happy to just hear that.

#### 11 ####
Here, take this as an
allowance.{wait:14} Don't squander
it all at once.

#### 12 ####
Received 120G!

#### 13 ####
That's unfortunate.{wait:14}
But I'm sure there are
people out there waiting
for your return...

#### 14 ####
If the day comes and
that happens, think about
us once in a while and
remember our village.

#### 15 ####
But let's forget that
for now.{wait:0A} That won't come
along for a while. {enter}
It's not good for an elder
like me to be so hasty,
hah hah.

#### 16 ####
Too bad.
It was empty.
