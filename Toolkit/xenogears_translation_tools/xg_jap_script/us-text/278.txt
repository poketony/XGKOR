Fei
"What? 
Who's that?"

#### 4 ####
Fei
"What are you doing?"

Elly
"Um...{wait:0A}
Thanks for helping."

Elly
"Why are you being
so kind?"

such bad people."

This is the underground
dock. Your Gears are 
being repaired here.

#### 12 ####
This is the underground dock.
Your ship is moored here.

#### 13 ####
This is the top of the tower.
The limitless sky!{wait:0A}
The sea!{wait:0A}
It'll be smooth sailing.

#### 14 ####
This is the top of the tower.
No Wels.
No Wels...{wait:0A}
{wait:0A}...May there not be any Wels.

#### 15 ####
This is the crane room.
We're not fishing up any
big items today.

#### 16 ####
Captain
"Hardy, I see you've
come back to visit.
Remember this."

#### 17 ####
Hang on to your hats!!

#### 18 ####
From the folks at Square!!

#### 19 ####
Xenogears!!

#### 20 ####
ON {wait:1E} SALE{wait:1E} NOW!!!

#### 21 ####
Captain
"Gahahahaha..."

#### 22 ####
Captain
"You're the two winos who
floated in with the Gears."

#### 23 ####
Captain
"Gahahahaha. Well, don't
take it so badly.{enter}
For us, anything we pull
out of the sea is treasure.{enter}
And you're a really big
important treasure.
We were really careful."

#### 24 ####
Captain
"What a pretty lady.
Oh, don't make that face.{enter}
I won't bite.
I'll return your Gears
to you squeaky clean."

#### 25 ####
Captain
"That's because..."

#### 26 ####
I am!

#### 27 ####
a man!

#### 28 ####
of the sea!

#### 29 ####
Captain
"Gahahaha..."

#### 30 ####
Captain
"You're probably starved.
I'll get you some food."

#### 31 ####
Captain
"Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaans!
I'll welcome the guests!
You take care of the rest."

#### 32 ####
Captain
"Of course I know that. 
How can you be so calm?"

#### 33 ####
Captain
"Hmph, yeah yeah."

#### 34 ####
Captain
"Lemme go and get
things ready."

#### 35 ####
Captain
"Go wait up on the deck.
I'll move 'em up there."

#### 36 ####
Captain
"Everything's okay.
The lady came back
unharmed."

#### 37 ####
Captain
"The Etones?
Oh, those guys who were
here earlier...{enter}
They left saying they had
to go investigate something.
They might be on the deck
near the supply entrance."

#### 38 ####
Captain
"If you're gonna mess with
them, we'll help however we
can.{enter}
If you wanna know about the
fishbowl headed towards the
excavation site, ask Hans."

#### 39 ####
Captain
"Oh, Citan.
You came because
you were worried?"

#### 40 ####
Citan
"Yes, you could say that.
But you seem to be better
off than I expected."

#### 41 ####
Captain
"Of course."

#### 42 ####
We are

#### 43 ####
Men!

#### 44 ####
of the Sea!!

#### 45 ####
Captain
"...Is what I'd like to
say...{enter}
...but the truth is the
situation's been pretty
bad.{enter}
We've got some that are
injured badly and some
that are fatal.{enter}
But considering what
happened to the other
ships, we're in no position
to complain.{enter}
And by the way, Citan. What
the hell is up with that
fishbowl thing?{enter}
It came out of nowhere and
kicked our butts and left
behind Wels.{enter}
And then, it headed for
some obscure excavation
site where there's supposed
to be nothing.{enter}
Odd, since we were sent
to go to a more deeper and
bigger excavation site."

#### 46 ####
Citan
"Just as I thought..."

#### 47 ####
Captain
"Some say they saw a huge
Gear-like monster.{enter}
It seemed like it was
guiding that fishbowl thing
to the excavation site.{wait:0A}
Or so I'm told."

#### 48 ####
Citan
"Stone{wait:0A}...{wait:0A}
It appears there is
something there for sure."

#### 49 ####
Captain
"Call it salvager's
intuition, but I don't
wanna get any closer.{enter}
And Citan, is that fishbowl
an enemy of yours?"

#### 50 ####
Citan
"You...{wait:0A}
could say that."

#### 51 ####
Captain
"Well, I won't ask for
revenge.{enter}
But I can't just sit back
and do nothing. If you're
against it, we'll help any
way we can.{enter}
You can ask Hans anything
about the site."

#### 52 ####
Captain
"What's wrong?
What do you need?{enter}
Point x1507, z1235?
Hans, does that sound
familiar?"

#### 53 ####
Hans
"It's Sargasso point."

#### 54 ####
Captain
"What?
The Sargasso?"

#### 55 ####
Fei
"Sargasso, what's that?"

#### 56 ####
Captain
"It's a cave formed from
microbes over many years.{enter}
It's supposed to have
hidden treasure but no
one's ever returned from
there.{enter}
The story is that the cave
itself is alive. Are you
going to the Sargasso?"

#### 57 ####
Fei
"It looks like it."

#### 58 ####
Captain
"Your Gears can't dive that
deep. If they did, you
would not be able to move.{enter}
Equip your underwater gear
here. Then take your ship
as far as you can and dive
in with your Gear.{enter}
I'll go wake those
winos up, right now."

#### 59 ####
Fei
"Really? It's okay with
you? Thanks for always
helping us out, Captain."

#### 60 ####
Captain
"Don't mention it."

#### 61 ####
Captain
"It looks like
they're done."

#### 62 ####
Fei
"That was fast."

#### 63 ####
Captain
"Of course.
We're..."

#### 64 ####
Fei
"Men, {wait:0A}of the sea, {wait:0A}right?"

#### 65 ####
Captain
"Blimey. {wait:05}
I think he's got it.{wait:0A}
Take care then."

#### 66 ####
Fei
"Yeah."

#### 67 ####
Captain
"Oh yeah, I forgot to tell
you how to operate them
underwater.{enter}
It's easy. You can jump in
water without your feet
touching the ground. Keep
jumping to build up speed.{enter}
You can swim pretty well in
a Gear, but there may be
places you can't get past
if you don't do it well."

#### 68 ####
Fei
"Got it.
Thanks."

#### 69 ####
Captain
"No need for thanks.{enter}
Maybe you can buy something
from our Gear shop. 
Looks like there be some
new booty to sell."

#### 70 ####
Captain
"Feel free to come back
to Thames anytime.{enter}
There's always room at
our dock for your ship."

#### 71 ####
You talked to the Captain?{wait:0A}
He's nice and all but...

#### 72 ####
Hans
"The one wandering around
over there's the Captain."

#### 73 ####
Hans
"Looks like there's gonna
be some trouble."

#### 74 ####
Hans
"Captain's great, isn't he?
Because of him the work
doesn't run out."

#### 75 ####
Hans
"Fishbowl was headed
due north.{enter}
The north edge of
that island...{wait:0A}
But why? There's nothing
there but a small mine."

#### 76 ####
Hans
"Since our work with the
'Ethos' has deep sixed
we've lost our 'porpoise'!{enter}
Guess we'll just have to
stick with wandering the
seas and salvaging.{enter}
Seems Thames will have to
continue this haphazard
lifestyle after all."

#### 77 ####
Let me introduce my
self. I'm Hans, the
ship's first mate.

#### 78 ####
Hans
"Yessir.
Just don't over do it."

#### 79 ####
Hans
"The captain and everyone
are so irresponsible."

#### 80 ####
I've held on to this seat
for 30 years.{enter}
I'm not losing it to some
young upstart.

#### 81 ####
I've held on to this seat
for 30 years.{enter}
But when Wels attacked, I
thought about running.

#### 82 ####
You can talk to other
areas aboard the Thames
through that intercom.

#### 83 ####
I remember seein' a high
tower a long time ago. It
was called Babel Tower.{enter}
Even I can't see the top of
it, and my eyes are good!{enter}
They say the Reapers called
Wels come from there.

#### 84 ####
I was surprised by the
Wels. They said they
came from Babel Tower.

#### 85 ####
Huh?
Isn't this a beer hall?

#### 86 ####
Huh?
Wels?
Where's Wels?

#### 87 ####
...{clear:64}

#### 88 ####
Fei
"!{wait:03}
That ship!"

#### 89 ####
Elly
"What?{wait:03}
What's wrong?"

#### 90 ####
Fei
"That's the
Yggdrasil!"

#### 91 ####
Elly
"Isn't that Bart's ship?"

#### 92 ####
Fei
"Yeah.{wait:03}
He's still alive.
Alright!{enter}
We can't just sit here!
Let's go!"

#### 93 ####
Elly
"Go where?"

#### 94 ####
Fei
"To help, what else?"

#### 95 ####
Elly
"Without a Gear?"

#### 96 ####
Fei
"Hmm..."

#### 97 ####
Captain
"Hold yer horses."

#### 98 ####
Captain
"Dock, this is the
bridge! How are our
guests' Gears?"

#### 99 ####
The repairs will
be done shortly.

#### 100 ####
Captain
"Two minutes."

#### 101 ####
Huh?

#### 102 ####
Captain
"Finish in two minutes!{enter}
Then take them out 
through the supply 
entrance to the deck!"

#### 103 ####
Y, yessir!

#### 104 ####
Captain
"Your Gears are being
moved to the deck.
Go get'em.{enter}
If you need to you can
buy equipment at the
supply entrance shop."

#### 105 ####
Hans
"What are you saying
Captain?{enter}
What if we get bombed
while we're caught up in
the middle of a fight?"

#### 106 ####
Captain
"Be quiet!!{wait:03}
Our guests are fighting
to save their friends.{enter}
Don't get in the way!{wait:05}
If we don't help, it'll
tarnish the men of the
sea's good name!!"

#### 107 ####
Hans
"...{wait:05}...{wait:14}Yessir.
But the Thames itself will
not join in any fights."

#### 108 ####
Fei
"Thanks. That's more
than enough."

#### 109 ####
Captain
"They've got guts starting
a fight next to the Thames!
It gets my blood boiling!"

#### 110 ####
Captain
"Hey Hans, I haven't
fired the big gun in
a long time.{enter}
How about we take a
shot or two?"

#### 111 ####
Hans
"Are you kidding?{enter}
Why get the Thames involved
in a fight between sides
who are neither enemies 
nor allies?{enter}
And that big gun is nothing
but a useless piece of junk
you tacked onto the Thames
in a drunken stupor!"

#### 112 ####
Captain
"You just don't
understand the code of
the men of the sea..."

#### 113 ####
Captain
"It seems like a
submarine is under
attack."

#### 114 ####
Fei
"Submarine?"

#### 115 ####
Captain
"I see you've brought
along another strapping
young lad."

#### 116 ####
Bart
"I'm Bart. Thanks for
letting my ship dock here."

#### 117 ####
Captain
"Gahahahahahahaha.
This's great. Ya come to
ask about the ship?"

#### 118 ####
Bart
"My submarine, Yggdrasil,
was damaged by an enemy
attack...{enter}
It'll be out of operation
for a little while..."

#### 119 ####
Margie
"Bart!
You're terrible.
You went on without me!"

#### 120 ####
Bart
"Aw Margie?
Just when I'm starting
to sound like a captain."

#### 121 ####
Margie
"I get away from Nisan
but then I'm stuck on
the Yggdrasil.{enter}
I'm sick of it.
Captain?
Hi, I'm Marguerite."

#### 122 ####
Bart
"Awww man! Look, we're
having a man to man talk
here.{enter}
So Margie, why don't you
go back to the Yggdrasil."

#### 123 ####
Margie
"You're terrible!
You're starting to
sound like Sig."

#### 124 ####
Bart
"What!
Me, like Sig?"

#### 125 ####
Margie
"You're always so
thoughtless, Bart.{enter}
Fei and the others
were floating around
because you fired on
that craft impulsively."

#### 126 ####
Bart
"Whoa, st, stupid,
you're not supposed to..."

#### 127 ####
Fei
"Bart...?
You...didn't...
No...you didn't..."

#### 128 ####
Citan
"It is true, Fei."

#### 129 ####
Bart
"Couldn't be helped.
How could I have known
you were..."

#### 130 ####
Fei
"I'm so disgusted, I
don't have anything
to say..."

#### 131 ####
Bart
"Don't get so mad."

#### 132 ####
Bart
"Tch. I shouldn't have
brought you out
of Nisan."

#### 133 ####
Margie
"I heard that,
you big jerk!"

#### 134 ####
Captain
"Gahahahaha.{wait:0F}
Great, great.
It's great to be young."

#### 135 ####
Captain
"Hey, kiddo.
You supposed to be some
kinda pirate?"

#### 136 ####
Bart
"Oh yeah.
A man of the sea!
I was a man of the
desert but..."

#### 137 ####
Captain
"Alright!!
Even better.
Yes, man of the sea!{enter}
Bart, right?
I'll show you to our
famous beer hall."

#### 138 ####
Captain
"My lady, may I borrow
this fellow?"

#### 139 ####
Margie
"What a weird guy."

#### 140 ####
Margie
"Fei, are you mad
about Bart?"

#### 141 ####
Fei
"No that's not it{wait:05}..."

#### 142 ####
Margie
"{wait:0A}...{wait:0A}...About Elly then?"

#### 143 ####
Fei
"{wait:05}...{wait:05}...Yeah."

#### 144 ####
Margie
"It'll all be okay.{enter}
If you're so worried,
why don't you go rescue
her?"

#### 145 ####
Margie
"Just like...{wait:05}
Bart helped me out."

#### 146 ####
Fei
"{wait:05}...{wait:05}..."

#### 147 ####
Fei
"Where's Elly?"

#### 148 ####
Hans
"She's seeing to the
Gear. She will be
along any time now."

#### 149 ####
Bart
"You mean{wait:05}...{wait:0A}
she was able to escape?"

#### 150 ####
Captain
"Well it's good for you.
Right, Fei?"

#### 151 ####
Fei
"Ah, yeah."

#### 152 ####
Fei
"Elly, are you okay?"

#### 153 ####
Elly
"{wait:0A}...{wait:0A}Yeah."

#### 154 ####
Bart
"..."

#### 155 ####
Elly
"What's that submarine?"

#### 156 ####
Fei
"Oh, you mean the
Yggdrasil?{enter}
It took a bad bashing,
so now it's here, at
Thames, for repairs."

#### 157 ####
Elly
"I see...{wait:0A}{enter}
Can I rest for a 
while?
{wait:05}...{wait:05}I'm exhausted."

#### 158 ####
Fei
"That's a good idea."

#### 159 ####
Bart
"Fei, it's my ship."

#### 160 ####
Captain
"Oi, oi.
She said she's tired.
Let her rest."

#### 161 ####
Elly
"Well, I'm going."

#### 162 ####
Bart
"...{wait:0A}
I don't like this."

#### 163 ####
Fei
"Bart you're still..."

#### 164 ####
Bart
"It's not like that.
She won't backstab us.{enter}
I was raised around thugs
and charlatans. I can
tell just by looking
in her eyes."

#### 165 ####
Fei
"Then you accept Elly..."

#### 166 ####
Bart
"That's why I can't.
She may be okay with it.{enter}
But what about her family
back home? Do you think
she can live with that?{enter}
Can she do that? Just get
rid of her family?
She has to decide.{enter}
She...Elly is probably
worrying about that.
We can't involve people
who have attachments."

#### 167 ####
Fei
"Bart..."

#### 168 ####
Bart
"Hmph, well do whatever
you want."

#### 169 ####
Captain
"What's that!?
Did you see that huge
fishbowl thing?"

#### 170 ####
Hans
"What are you asking
me for...?"

#### 171 ####
Captain
"Weren't the other
salvager fleets almost
blown away by one shot?{enter}
Is this the way the
'Ethos' greets us?"

#### 172 ####
Hans
"I seriously doubt that!{enter}
Why do they have to 
attack us? We only
came to help with 
excavations..."

#### 173 ####
C, captain, Wels Reapers!
Reapers are coming out of
that fishbowl thing in the
dozens!

#### 174 ####
Captain
"What!?"

#### 175 ####
Hans
"Why...?
This can't be happening..."

#### 176 ####
Captain
"...{wait:0A}...{wait:1E}
Launch the Gears!
Load the big gun!"

#### 177 ####
Hans
"Captain!?"

#### 178 ####
Captain
"Alright, y'all!{enter}
We're going to assist and
rescue any of the survivors
from the other ships...{enter}
...if at all possible while
trying to retreat!{enter}
And shoot down those Wels
with our two guns!
Don't let those filthy
Wels get near our Thames!"

#### 179 ####
Captain
"Hans!
Look alive!{enter}
Take the helm!
We'll show that fishbowl
thing how real men of
the sea retreat!"

#### 180 ####
Hans
"Y, yessir!"
