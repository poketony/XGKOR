Fei
"You knew what Solaris
was doing to the surface
dwellers...{enter}
And you know what the
situation is like now
on the earth...
And yet you..."

#### 3 ####
Fei
"Power and ability have
nothing to do with it.{enter}
It was pure coincidence
that we didn't mutate."

Elly
"Dominia...{wait:1E}
Do you truly believe that?"

#### 5 ####
Elly
"You were all once
surface dwellers.{enter}
Weren't you all forced
to live under the
oppression of Solaris?{enter}
I KNOW that you know
how it feels to be a
'have-not', so why do
you...?"

#### 6 ####
Elly
"That is just the
providence of those
who are the 'haves'!"

#### 7 ####
Billy
"Elements!"

#### 8 ####
Billy
"People are people.
Nothing more or less.{enter}
I admit that there are
the weak and powerless.{enter}
But that's no reason
for us to forsake them.{enter}
We are all the same
human beings!"

Dominia
"I see you've gained a new
Gear that has been aligned
with an Anima Relic."

#### 15 ####
Dominia
"What the Gazel do or what-
ever happens to the Lambs,
are not my concerns.{enter}
Each of us have our own
obligations to fulfill.{enter}
We don't have time to deal
with affairs concerning you
weak and inferior people."

#### 16 ####
Dominia
"Yes.
Look at yourselves,
for instance...{enter}
You, the strong and the
superior, were the first
to preserve yourselves,
without any mutations.{enter}
Is that not right?"

#### 17 ####
Dominia
"So...
You wish to give a hand to
those who would be saved?"

#### 18 ####
Dominia
"Hmph.{enter}
So be it then, show me
this providence of yours
that wishes to save the
meager 'have-nots'!"

#### 19 ####
Dominia
"Here I come!"{clear:1E}

#### 20 ####
Dominia
"Hah...{enter}
We may have fared poorly
when we fought in the
flesh, but we will finish
you off in our Gears!"

#### 21 ####
Dominia
"Come!
Follow me!"

#### 22 ####
Kelvena
"You know that we should
have been the ones to have
it...{enter}
We need stronger powers in
order for Commander Ramsus
to realize his long-
cherished desires."

#### 23 ####
Kelvena
"How commendable.
But...{wait:14}is that really
what's best for mankind?"

#### 24 ####
Kelvena
"People must be able to
stand on their own in any
circumstances they are in.{enter}
Overprotection only stunts
the will to be independent.{enter}
This stunts the growth of
the people and the world.
We've experienced that
first hand.{enter}
Live by one's own strength,
stand on one's own feet!
It's sad but true that the
weak will be weeded out...{enter}
But we cannot look back.
That is the providence of
human existence."

let us have it!"
