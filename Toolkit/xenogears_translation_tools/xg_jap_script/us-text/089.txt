Margie
"The sisters are still
singing downstairs, so they
won't be back for a while."

#### 2 ####
Margie
"Let's go to the
painting room.{enter}
The sisters will
probably be back
by then."

#### 3 ####
Margie
"I wonder what kind
of person Sophia was.{enter}
I would have loved to
have met her."

#### 4 ####
I've got do my best too!

#### 5 ####
A new era is approaching...{wait:1E}
I've got to do my best too!

#### 6 ####
Everyone is alive!{wait:1E}
Thank god.

#### 7 ####
We're transcribing scrolls.{enter}
Scrolls over 100 years old
get worn, so we renew them.{enter}
It is one of our daily
tasks.

#### 8 ####
Take care now!

#### 9 ####
Just because the monarchy
has been abolished, it
does not mean that peace
will automatically prevail.{enter}
From now on, citizens must
build this country anew
with their own hands.{enter}
Undoubtedly, new ordeals
will await us.

#### 10 ####
Thank heavens you're safe!

#### 11 ####
Why does war never
disappear from this world?{enter}
To me, it is clear that
it is meaningless...{enter}
Perhaps it is our fate
to be forever at discord
with each other?

#### 12 ####
We look forward to the
dawn of the true world!

#### 13 ####
Recognition of the existence
of Solaris may present a new
way of looking at the Nisan
orthodoxy.{enter}
In that sense, I believe
we have finally reached a
new starting point.

#### 14 ####
After seeing everyone in
high spirits, a new sense
of hope rose within me!

#### 15 ####
The road we must take
is out there somewhere.{enter}
A way out of the confusion
we are now facing...{enter}
The sister sitting diagonally
across from me, is desperately
looking for that answer.

#### 16 ####
I thought it appropriate for
you and your deeds to be
told to future generations.{enter}
So I have discussed this with
Sister Agnes and we concluded
that your many travels and
experiences be recorded by me.{enter}
Therefore,{wait:1E}
please come back alive!{enter}
Your accomplishments will be
passed on from generation to
generation!

#### 17 ####
(...{wait:1E} Somewhere...{wait:1E}
It must be somewhere...{enter}
The truth that we have
not yet come to know.)

#### 18 ####
Oh!?{wait:1E} That scared me.

#### 19 ####
Fei
"You're very devoted."

#### 20 ####
Uh, well sort of...{enter}
It's just that after
sneaking into the capital,
I started to think about
a lot of things...{enter}
And I've come to realize{wait:1E}
the world isn't right
the way it is now!

#### 21 ####
Yes, {wait:1E} the world isn't right
the way it is now!

#### 22 ####
Yes, {wait:1E} the world isn't right
the way it is now!

#### 23 ####
The others left in order
to go help the evacuating
citizens.{enter}
I remained to help Sister
Agnes look after herself
and the things here.

#### 24 ####
Voluntarily declaring
republicanism yourself
is amazing.{enter}
It would be great if
Bartholomew became
president.{enter}
But, it would not be much of
a change from the way things
are now, though would it?{enter}
In any case, I think
Master Bartholomew would
be just fine.

#### 25 ####
Agnes
"The one pictured in the
portrait in the painting
room is Sophia.{enter}
She is the first great
mother of Nisan.{enter}
According to legend, the
portrait was painted
about 500 years ago.

#### 26 ####
Agnes
"I understand you were
shown Sophia's portrait.{enter}
The lady portrayed in
that picture is Nisan's
great founding mother...{enter}
Some say that it was
painted at least 500
years ago.

#### 27 ####
Citan
"500 years ago...{wait:1E}
Now that is quite amazing.{enter}
Personally, I find it
intriguing. Do you have
any historical material
from that period?

#### 28 ####
Agnes
"In our hands, there are no
such records left intact.{enter}
All records and materials
concerning Sophia have
been lost...{enter}
The portrait is the only
thing left.{enter}
We too do not have much
knowledge about her."

#### 29 ####
Citan
"That is too bad!
So there really is
nothing left at all!?"

#### 30 ####
Agnes
"For someone who has helped
Marguerite, I would have
loved to have shared them...{enter}
But unfortunately I am
unable to help here..."

#### 31 ####
Citan
"Oh well, none the matter.
Please do not worry about
it. I was just inquiring."

#### 32 ####
Citan
"But, it does seem
somewhat strange...{enter}
If such a majestic building
as this survived history,
then it is likely a scroll
or two would remain too."

#### 33 ####
Agnes
"According to tradition,
Sophia was present about
500 years ago...{enter}
She sacrificed herself for
the people and has been
summoned to be with god.
That's all I can tell you."

#### 34 ####
Citan
"...I see.{wait:1E}
So everything was lost in
the darkness of history."

#### 35 ####
Agnes
"I was speaking earlier
with Marguerite, and she
led me to believe that
you are heading to Aveh."

#### 36 ####
Bart
"Yeah. We might cause a
little trouble for the
folks of Nisan...{enter}
But it's something that
I simply cannot avoid."

#### 37 ####
Agnes
"Yes, I understand.{enter}
Just that, if you allow me
to say my true feelings...{enter}
I wish that you could find
a way to bring peace to this
country without bloodshed...{enter}
But I will not try to stop
you now, Master Bartholomew.{enter}
You must have put in much
thought before making this
decision.{enter}
We of Nisan, will be with
you, Master Bartholomew."

#### 38 ####
Bart
"Thanks Sister."

#### 39 ####
Fei
"Yes."

#### 40 ####
Agnes
"Where is Master
Bartholomew?"

#### 41 ####
Fei
"He's in town talking
with Margie."

#### 42 ####
Agnes
"I see my child.{wait:1E}
Then please tell him this...{enter}
 'We will always be with
 you, Master Bartholomew.' "

#### 43 ####
Fei
"I'll be sure to relay
that to him, Sister."

your battles are safe
and successful."

#### 64 ####
Agnes
"Everyone is safe and well!
Oh{wait:1E}... Thank heavens.{enter}
How is Marguerite?{enter}
We here are all doing well,
so please tell her that."

#### 65 ####
Agnes
"I hope nothing has
happend to the great
mother's remains...{enter}
If the mausoleum becomes
damaged in any way, I'll
have no right to live."

#### 66 ####
Bart
"Don't be so hard
on yourself.{enter}
You sisters have done your
best to protect the town,
right?
Just leave the rest to us."

#### 67 ####
Agnes
"Finally, we can create
the country the late king
and Great Mother desired.{enter}
I hope that I can be of
assistance to master
Bartholemew.{enter}
Before we do that though,
we'll have to determine the
the real relation between 
Bartholomew and Marguerite.{enter}
But come to think of it,
that is really up to 
them to work out..."

#### 68 ####
Agnes
"To pass on the deeds you
people have accomplished,
we have decided to record
your journey...{enter}
As the ones who, along with
the Great Mother Marguerite,
lead us to our true world...{enter}
You will live forever in
the hearts and minds of
the people that live on
this planet."
