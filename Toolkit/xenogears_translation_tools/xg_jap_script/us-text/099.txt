Ever since my oldest son
was drafted, I've been
so lonely.{enter}
My younger son is up on
the roof looking north.{wait:0A}
Ahh...{wait:0A} I hope my boy
comes home safely...{enter}
He's such a gentle child,
I'm worried how he'll
make it in the army.{enter}
He used to arrange the
flower upstairs.
But now I make them as
I pray for his safety.

My oldest son came back!{enter}
My prayers were answered.
Now I'm putting all my
effort into cooking.
