What was all the
fighting between us and
Aveh?{enter}
Solaris must have been
manipulating it all...

#### 2 ####
There's some suspicious
activity in Aveh. They
could attack anytime.

#### 3 ####
...I wish I could've
seen Goliath in action...

#### 4 ####
This is the new battle
ship, Goliath!{enter}
With its completion,
Aveh and Solaris will
have to submit to us.

#### 5 ####
Apparently, the Kaiser
had deeper plans. I was
just too shallow.

#### 6 ####
What is the Kaiser
thinking? Now's the only
chance to strike at Aveh.

#### 7 ####
Your Gear is awesome!
What's it called?

#### 8 ####
I saw your incredible
Gear in sub dock!
What's it called?

#### 9 ####
I'm going to keep on
fighting even if I'm the
only one left...
But...how would that work?

#### 10 ####
I'm prepared to fight
even if I'm the last one.

#### 11 ####
Who would've thought
a pirate fighting against
Aveh was really the Prince
of Fatima...?

#### 12 ####
Aveh and some pirates 
clashed at the border.
Something serious happened
there.

#### 13 ####
I'm doing some Gear
maintenance today at the
dock¡­{wait:28} But, they're
only battle Gears.{enter}
A lot of people go in an'
out without authorization.
It's good money.

#### 14 ####
Ultimately, the only
way to end this war is to
strike out at Solaris.

#### 15 ####
Currently, Aveh is a
puppet government.{enter}
Ramsus, a Gebler officer,
is the one who holds the
true power.
