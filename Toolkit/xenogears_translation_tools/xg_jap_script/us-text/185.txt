The outskirts of D-Block?"

#### 2 ####
Hammer
"Oh, I forgot to tell you!{enter}
The Battling Arena is on 
the outskirts of D-Block.{wait:0F}
Talk to the guard and he 
should let you pass. Bye!"

#### 3 ####
Hammer
"Bro, I have news!{wait:0F}
News!"{clear:2D}

#### 4 ####
Hammer
"The new doctor who was 
appointed today has just
arrived!"

#### 5 ####
Hammer
"Bro, I have news!{wait:0F}
News!"{clear:2D}

#### 6 ####
Hammer
"The new doctor who was
appointed today has just
arrived!"

#### 7 ####
I know you're being
pursued, but relax!
Here in D-Block nobody
turns on the Champ.{enter}
'mongst the inmates of
Nortune's D-Block, the
Battling Champion is 
THE absolute sovereign.{enter}
If any of the Imperial
capital's officials
come nosing about, no
prisoner's gonna squeal!

#### 8 ####
{wait:05}...{wait:05}What business does an
ordinary person have here?{enter}
If you're not a prisoner
and you come here, then you
must be either overly
curious, or plain stupid!

#### 9 ####
The new doctor that came
after that lady doctor got
put in charge of civilians,
barely works here anymore!{enter}
It's got to the point that
if you get injured you have
to buy Aquasol with your
own money and cure yourself!{enter}
Where did he go to?{wait:05}
Oh,{wait:05} and don't you think he
looks a lot like the guy
that hangs around the Champ?

#### 10 ####
I'm glad you spoke to me!
See I'm nice to new inmates.
So ask anything you want to!{enter}
What's bothering you?
    Where's the 'supplier'?
    What's with the sewers?
    Nothing's bothering me!

#### 11 ####
{wait:05}...{wait:05}Supplier?
Oh, you mean Hammer!
He's probably at the bar.
You'll know him when you
see him!{enter}
Go out the east door, turn
right, and then keep going
straight ahead.
The place with the neon
sign is the bar!

#### 12 ####
Ahh, the 'Kislev Sewers'!
Why not see for yourself!
Go out the west door and
climb the ladder{wait:05}...{enter}
Then once you're on the roof,
the ladder you can see to
the northwest descends into
the 'Kislev Sewers'!

#### 13 ####
You'll know it by the guy
standing watch near the
entrance. That's his job!

#### 14 ####
If you get stuck, just ask me!

#### 15 ####
Hey, what's the trouble?
    Any new information?
    Not troubled at all!

#### 16 ####
The lady doctor of the dorm!
They say she got put in
charge of A-Block!{wait:0F} ...{wait:05}She
wasn't downstairs was she?

#### 17 ####
A-Block's the civilian area
of the Imperial capital
Nortune. That's quite a 
step up for one so young!{enter}
As a replacement, it looks
like we will be getting a
new doctor to look after
us in D-Block!

#### 18 ####
If you get stuck, just ask me!

#### 19 ####
Hey, what's the trouble?
    Any new information?
    Not troubled at all!

#### 20 ####
The new medical doctor who
just came is quite skilled.{wait:0F}
Have you seen him yet?

#### 21 ####
Nope! No new info lately!

#### 22 ####
Aveh's actions could mean
disaster for us!{enter}
Because of these explosive
collars, us prisoners can't
flee, even if we wanted to!{enter}
If they're not careful, all
of us inmates could die!

#### 23 ####
I am glad that that sewer
monster affair is over.
Now I can get back to work!

#### 24 ####
Today's earnings weren't so
great{wait:05}...{wait:05}{enter}
Boy I wish there was a whole
nest of monsters somewhere,{wait:05}
then I'd have it made!{wait:05} Huh!

#### 25 ####
A body of one of the Champ's
immediate subordinates was
found in the sewers!{enter}
Knowing that a monster big
enough to do that is lurking
below us{wait:05}...{wait:05}sure is scary!{wait:0F}
It gives me the shivers!

#### 26 ####
Thanks to the Champ, the
sewer monster problem
is over.{enter}
Oh, and I heard from
the entrance watchman that
you fought against it too!?

#### 27 ####
You're quite a fighter,
aren't you!?

#### 28 ####
I hear the Imperial capital
bigwigs are searching to
question the former champ.{enter}
I guess it's because of the
rumors about assassinating
the Kaiser. I can't wait to
hear how this turns out!

#### 29 ####
It seems that after the bout,
the former champ's Gear moved
on it's own accord and crashed 
right into the Kaiser's stand!{enter}
The pilot, Rico, was not found
within the Gear, so they put
it down to the machine going
out of control!

#### 30 ####
Another murder in the sewers!{wait:0F}
This time it was Vargas{wait:05}...!{wait:05}
What in blazes is going on!?

#### 31 ####
Say, didn't you{wait:05}...{wait:1E}
{wait:05}...{wait:05}Nothing, forget it!

#### 32 ####
{wait:05}...{wait:05}Soon they will start the
Battling Imperial Games that
will be watched by the Kaiser
himself{wait:05}...{wait:05} Right then's{wait:05}...

#### 33 ####
Yeah{wait:05}...{wait:05}errh{wait:05}...{wait:05}
right then's our chance! {wait:0F}
We'll use a Gear{wait:05}...{wait:05}and make
it look like an accident{wait:05}...

#### 34 ####
!?{clear:1E}

#### 35 ####
{fast:FF}What's with you!? Get lost!!

#### 36 ####
Due to the sewer monster
commotion, they made it off
limits!{wait:05} How are we supposed
to work now?{wait:05} Damn it!

#### 37 ####
That entrance watchman{wait:05}...{wait:05}
-the nerve of the bastard!-
{wait:05}...{wait:05}said he wouldn't let me
in unless I slip him some
money! That makes me seethe!

#### 38 ####
I'm a wandering Battler{wait:05}...!{wait:05}
The Battling Games are over,
so I am thinking of leaving
in search of newer battle-
fields.{wait:0F} Oh{wait:05}...{wait:05}and don't you
dare ask me how it went!

#### 39 ####
I'm a wandering Battler. {wait:0F}
I came here to participate
in the Battling matches they
will be holding here soon.{enter}
It seems I got here a tad
bit too early!
Sooo, now what am I to do?

#### 40 ####
I'm a wandering Battler. {wait:0F}
This town's now in a tumult
over a sewer monster.{wait:0F}
They say that two expert
Battlers got killed!{enter}
It seems they were well
known around here too!{wait:0F}
And to think, both killed!{wait:0F}
Must of been some creature!{wait:0F}
Ohh, heaven forbid!

#### 41 ####
What, you want the run-down?
    Narh, not interested.
    Yeah, spare no details!

#### 42 ####
{wait:05}...{wait:05}Suit yourself!

#### 43 ####
{wait:05}...{wait:05}Well aren't you studious?{wait:0F}
Here goes the long version!

#### 44 ####
Nortune, the capital of the
Kislev Empire, is made up of
five blocks.{wait:0F}
D Block is just one of them.
It serves as a giant prison.

#### 45 ####
A Block's the general town
area, while B Block is the 
industrial area.{enter}
C Block houses recreational
facilities, including the 
Imperial Capital's biggest
'Battling Arena' .{enter}
Gear faces Gear in bouts of 
single combat - that's what
'Battling' is all about!{enter}
And lastly, there is the
'Central Area', from where
Kaiser Sigmund rules over 
the whole Kislev Empire.

#### 46 ####
There's a rumor that, behind
the scenes, the 'Ethos' is
actually involved with the
'B-Info. Center'.{enter}
Officially the 'Battling
Committee' is run by the
Imperial capital, but it
too is rumored to be an 
agent of the 'Ethos'.

#### 47 ####
Of course this is all gossip!

#### 48 ####
There's talk that recently
the Champ himself conducted
a 'Baptismal Ceremony'.{enter}
I don't know whether it's 
true, but I feel for which
ever prisoner received it!

#### 49 ####
Hmm{wait:05}...{wait:05}but then again{wait:05}...{wait:05}
it might have been Suzarn.{wait:0F}
Or,{wait:05} hold on,{wait:05} was it Vargas?{clear:3C}

#### 50 ####
And to think, the entrance
watchman helped him out so
much.{wait:0F} I bet the watchman's
taking it badly!

#### 51 ####
There was another victim in
the sewers.{wait:0F} That makes four!{enter}
He wasn't a direct subordinate
of the Champ, but he was a
skilled extermination worker!

#### 52 ####
I'm a Battler in training,
with Prisoner Rank C!{wait:0F}
Looky here, today's menu is
{wait:05}...{wait:05}wooh!{wait:05} ...{wait:05}'Stamina Uppen'!{enter}
Whahow! If I eat this up,
I'll increase my stamina 
and before you know it 
I'll be a Battle Master!{wait:1E}
{wait:05}...{wait:05}I hope that happens!

#### 53 ####
¡ù Note: That won't happen!{clear:2D}

#### 54 ####
I'm a Battler in training,

Goody-goody, today's menu is
{wait:05}...{wait:05}wooh!{wait:05}...{wait:05}'Ether Omega'!{enter}
Whahow! When I eat this, my
Ether value will shoot up
and, before you know it,
I'll be an Ether Master!{wait:1E}
{wait:05}...{wait:05}Man, I hope that happens!

#### 55 ####
¡ù Note: That won't happen!{clear:2D}

#### 56 ####
In 'Battling', men and women
are called different names.{wait:05}
Generally, males are called 
'Battlers', while females
are called 'Amazonesses'.

#### 57 ####
Male or female doesn't 
matter on the battlefield!
Strength is everything!
Only the strong survive!

#### 58 ####
A while back, an airborne
battleship was stolen from
the military facility north
of the Imperial capital.{enter}
Later, contact was lost
with it somewhere above
the seas around Aquvy.

#### 59 ####
I can understand someone
stealing Gear parts from
the military facility near
the capital, but a whole
flying battleship?
That's going a bit too far!

#### 60 ####
Who would have thought that
someone could beat Ricardo,
Battling's undefeated Champ!{enter}
I don't mean disrespect
to the new champion, but
I just don't believe it!

#### 61 ####
Sorry, forget I ever said that!

#### 62 ####
The sewer monster commotion
was solved by the efforts of
Rico, our Champ, and the off
limits order was lifted!{enter}
But, I heard the Champ was
wounded in the arm while
exterminating the monster.{enter}
Not suprising seeing that 
five Battlers got killed!

#### 63 ####
In this town, when you take
proof of extermination of
sewer monsters to 'B-Info.',{enter}
they will exchange it for G,
the currency of this world.
It'll pay to remember this!

#### 64 ####
Probably went to the bar...?
But isn't it unusual for the 
Imperial capital's bigwigs
to come to D block!?

#### 65 ####
{wait:05}...{wait:05}The Imperial capital's
Battling Committee members?
Hmm, don't see them here now.{enter}
There was a group of three
people who came earlier,
but they've left.

#### 66 ####
I once heard the sound of a
bell in the sewers.
Perhaps it was a monster who
wore it, but that bell had a
sorrowful tone when rung.

#### 67 ####
It was so sorrowful,{wait:05} just
as if it was recalling
some sad memory{wait:05}...

#### 68 ####
{wait:05}...{wait:05}Huh? That means he's even
more powerful than our
current champ{wait:05}...{wait:05}doesn't it?

#### 69 ####
Then that's no good at all!
It's only made matters worse!{wait:0F}
Oh, how I want more power{wait:05}...{wait:05}!

#### 70 ####
{wait:05}...{wait:05}The Champ's strength is 
incredible. If only someone
would defeat the Champ{wait:05}...{wait:05}
then I might have a chance.

#### 71 ####
They say there was another
victim found this morning!
That makes five{wait:05}...{wait:05}and Rank
A too!{enter}
I can't believe that
it was Suzarn, one of the
Champ's famous gang members!

#### 72 ####
Nothing like this has ever
happened up until now!
Hey, aren't you THAT guy...

#### 73 ####
Err, nothing, forget it.

#### 74 ####
Our food is famous throughout
the Imperial capital!{enter}
Especially our dishes cooked
according to Ether theory,
like 'Boosta Limit' and
'HeavyWeighter'...{enter}
We provide according to rank
A or B, so you can only have
one or the other.{enter}
And it differs
with the individual,
but they are said to bring 
about remarkable effects!

#### 75 ####
Why do you leave food
on your plates? If you
can't eat all of it...
then don't order it!

#### 76 ####
Haahh!!{clear:1E}

#### 77 ####
{wait:05}...{wait:05}You shouldn't just 
walk into the kitchen.{wait:0A}
That's bad manners!

#### 78 ####
Oh no you don't!{wait:0A} The kitchen
is off limits to prisoners!

#### 79 ####
Cooking requires love that
is deeper than the seas! And
enticing the partakers of our
food to the peaks of bliss is
the job of cooks like us!

#### 80 ####
That's right{clear:1E}

Oh, you mean those three?"

Hammer
"Oh, bro!
You shouldn't worry about
such little details!{enter}
If you just rely on me, the
forefront of information,
then you will know it all!{wait:0F}
So about this doctor{wait:05}...{wait:05}"

Fei
"...The new doctor, eh?{wait:0A}{enter}
So, what on earth has this
new doctor got to do with 
you, the great 'supplier'?"

#### 175 ####
Hammer
"What are you talking about
bro?{wait:0F} Of course I have
everything to do with him!{enter}
If I become chums with him,
I can expand my connections
by establishing black market
medical treatment routes!"

#### 176 ####
Fei
"...So that's it, huh?
Oh, Hammer, what will
we ever do with you?"

#### 177 ####
Hammer
"Whatever bro, whatever.{wait:05}
Anyway, let's go say
hello to him, shall we?"

#### 178 ####
Fei
"Well, yeah, I suppose we
should at least say hello."

Rico

Fei
"Oh,{wait:05} errh, sorry!"

Fei
"Later, the doc said he 
wanted to pay the courtesy
of burying the monster...{enter}
so I waited outside."

Rico
"{wait:05}...{wait:05}Is that so? Oh well,
at least the murders have
been brought to an end!"

Citan
"Yes, that is right.{wait:0F}
And Fei has been proved
innocent as well!"

#### 184 ####
Rico
"{wait:05}...{wait:05}{enter}
And I guess the
out-of-bounds order on the
sewers was lifted straight
after that too {wait:05}...{enter}
Anyway, my allying with you
ends here{wait:05}...{wait:05}
The next time we meet,{wait:05} Fei,{wait:05}

Fei
"Hey, what about that wound
to your arm?{wait:0F} You can't try
to Battle in that state!"

#### 187 ####
Rico
"{wait:05}...{wait:1E}
Can you really afford to 
worry about your opponent?"

Fei
"...But, Rico?"

Rico
"Worry about yourself before
others!{wait:0F} Don't hold back now!{wait:05}

#### 195 ####
Citan
"Does his arm wound bother
you that much?{wait:1E} Fei, you
realize we don't have{wait:05}..."

Fei
"I know doc{wait:05}...{wait:05}
