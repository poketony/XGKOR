Arbot Plaza's ahead.{wait:0A}
No one is being allowed
through without business!

#### 3 ####
You have a ticket.{wait:0A} 
Alright, go on through.{wait:0A} 
Better hurry or you won't
make it in time.

#### 4 ####
These are special seats 
for the Dedication.{wait:0A} 
Huh?{wait:0A} No ticket?{wait:0A}
You can't go in...

#### 5 ####
Huh?{wait:0A} What kind of person?{wait:0A} 
Why, a Solaris beauty,
of course.

#### 6 ####
As a service to citizens,
we now are accepting data
for the marriage service.{enter}
The Central Control Bureau
will pick the very best
match for you. {enter}
Our motto is 'Good matches
make good descendants'.{enter}
We are the seed that came
from it, so of course we 
are the best.

#### 7 ####
The Dedication Ceremony 
was amazing!!

#### 8 ####
Whaddya think of these
Pogoshoes?{wait:0A} 
They were made from
the newest technology.{enter}
They don't put stress
on your spine, they're
the best.{enter}
The Imperial model is a
super cool ultra rare
item.

#### 9 ####
'The dedication ends 
with huge fanfare'...{wait:0A} 
It was great.

#### 10 ####
The Dedication is 
starting soon.

#### 11 ####
'Success of the Imperial
Gate Removal Plan'...{wait:0A}
It was the will of 
the Emperor.

#### 12 ####
'Solaris Defense Field
Destroyed'...{wait:0A}
Those savages are really
in trouble now.

#### 13 ####
Hmm, the newest model 
anti-grav car, 'Roach'.{wait:0A} 
The design needs a little
work.

#### 14 ####
Did you hear the Emperor
and Krelian's broadcast?{wait:0A} 
It was magnificent...{wait:0A}{enter}
But that Ramsus is 
unforgiveable.{wait:0A}
Always at the Emperor's
feet!

#### 15 ####
There seems to be a big 
struggle on the surface.{enter}
But it has absolutely 
nothing to do with us.{enter}
As long as the Emperor is
with us, we can live in
peace. {enter}
Jumping out of a frying
pan just might land you
in the fire...{enter}
That stupid Ramsus hasn't
learned that yet.

#### 16 ####
Long live the Emperor!!

#### 17 ####
You can get whatever
you want here.{enter}
Look, I should have lost
this arm in an accident,
but with Solaris' biosampling
Look, no scar.{enter}
There are none of the 
crimes, disasters or wars
like on earth.{enter}
Science makes everything
possible for us.

#### 18 ####
Whenever I look up I see
Solaris' battleships...{wait:0A}
It makes me feel safe
just seeing them.

#### 19 ####
Just looking down and
seeing the earth I think...{wait:0A}
Those poor souls can't
live in this fine city.{enter}
Even if they destroy the
gate, it's all a waste
of effort...{enter}
Futile resistance from 
those who will never
reach our paradise.

#### 20 ####
Did you hear the Emperor's 
magnificent speech?{enter}
It brings me to tears just 
hearing his deep baritone.{wait:0A} 
You too?

#### 21 ####
The Emperor will give 
the speech himself.{enter}
He can't stand to see our 
confusion anymore so he 
went out of the way to 
make an appearance.{enter}
We should be thankful.

#### 22 ####
The Emperor is great
but this is the DK1200!

#### 23 ####
Yaay! The Emperor!

#### 24 ####
The Dk1200 is so cool!
They improved it, so it
dances and sings
perfectly.{wait:0A}{enter}
I can't wait to download
the newest songs.

#### 25 ####
Two strange people were
just being chased by 
Security Cubes...{enter}
I wonder if they were the
ones Krelian mentioned?{enter}
You're a 3rd Class citizen
but you wouldn't do that,
right?

#### 26 ####
You have a ticket? {wait:0A}
You'd better hurry to 
make it on time!

#### 27 ####
Up ahead is Arbot Plaza.{wait:0A} 
The Dedication ceremony 
is about to start but you 
don't have a ticket so...

#### 28 ####
...{wait:0A}
You look rather odd.{enter}
3rd Class citizens should
dress more appropriate.

#### 29 ####
The Dedication is 
starting.{wait:0A} 
The whole city will 
be lively.

Solaris is probably not 
doing so well now."

#### 55 ####
Fei
"Huh? {wait:0A}
Why do we have to watch
this? {enter}
We decided to meet
everyone. We don't have
time to go this
festival."

#### 56 ####
Elly
"This is no ordinary 
festival.{enter}
The people are disturbed
by the gate's
disappearance.{enter}
The dedication is probably
to quell the masses.{enter}
We must check Solaris'
stance against land 
dwellers.{enter}
Fei,{wait:0A} 
we need to get tickets."

#### 57 ####
Fei
"Yeah?{wait:0A} 
I guess we have to get 
some info on the enemy..."

Elly
"Hurry up.{wait:0A} 
There's not much time 
till the Dedication."
