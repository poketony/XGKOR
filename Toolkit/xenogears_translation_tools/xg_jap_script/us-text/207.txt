Captain
"Our war isn't over yet.{enter}
The Central District
exists to do battle with
the real enemy."

#### 2 ####
Captain
"When will we be able to
use our real power...?"

#### 3 ####
Why do you think we have a
bridge here? Hah hah hah?

#### 4 ####
Many were injured in the
last Kislev-Aveh war.{enter}
Even my family...{enter}
War only leaves misery.

#### 5 ####
The power of the 'Ethos'
still exists as strong
as ever in Kislev...{enter}
But many ordinary citizens
died trying to oppose the
influence of the 'Ethos'.

#### 6 ####
A peace treaty has
been signed with Aveh.{enter}
Let's hope it lasts...

#### 7 ####
Kislev and Aveh almost had
a truce once before. {enter}
But the relationship 
worsened due to Gebler.

#### 8 ####
Ever hear of a red Gear?
I hear it took out a Gebler
unit.{enter}
If only he'd be our savior.

#### 9 ####
Lately, the Kaiser's been
shutting himself out from
the world.{enter}
Imagine how happy he'd be
if his family returned...

#### 10 ####
The 'Ethos' has been using
a human rights movement to
usurp political power.{enter}
In a recent parade, there
was an attempt on the life
of the Kaiser.{enter}
Fortunately, they failed,
but we don't know when they
might strike again...

#### 11 ####
I never went on even one
mission.{enter}
I don't know whether to be
happy or sad.

#### 12 ####
Never knowing when you may
get a mission can drive you
nuts.{enter}
If I knew it was gonna be
like this, I woulda stayed
at the docks fixing Gears.

#### 13 ####
I may not have deserved to,
but I made it back alive.

#### 14 ####
I'm going on a mission soon.{enter}
I may not make it back, but
I'm still ready for it.

#### 15 ####
Now I'm even more confused
with the way things are.{enter}
Peace with Aveh probably
won't last.

#### 16 ####
The lower ranks don't know
how the war's going...{enter}
Some of them are panicky
making them very hard to
lead...{enter}
What would we do if they
attacked now?

#### 17 ####
Hey!{wait:1E} The train oughtta
be coming 'round now.

#### 18 ####
Why?

#### 19 ####
Oh yeah...{wait:28} You were
in D Block, right?

#### 20 ####
Even nameless soldiers
have lives to live.
Remember that...

#### 21 ####
Even nameless soldiers
have lives to live.
Remember that...

#### 22 ####
Oh, Gear maintainence...?{enter}
I quit that job.

#### 23 ####
I don't wanna go to D Block.
I got bad memories there.{enter}
Anyhow, they'd send me back
if they found out I made it
this high up.

#### 24 ####
A Gear decimated an elite
unit of Gears in Lahan.

#### 25 ####
A Gear decimated an elite
unit of Gears in Lahan.

#### 26 ####
Actually, there was one
survivor from Lahan.{enter}
But he seems to be going
through a mental breakdown.
What happened there...?
