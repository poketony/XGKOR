Dominia
"I have no intention of
discussing this matter
further with you!{enter}
Your traitorous actions
are already apparent!
I will beat you down
right here!!"

Stop it at once.

Miang
"Are you okay?"

#### 6 ####
Dominia
"Miang!
What are you doing!?
She is a traitor!"

Miang
"Such acts will not be
allowed on a ship under
Ramsus' command...{enter}
No matter the reason!{enter}
I have examined the
records of the battle
between the Haishao and
{name:0D:ヴィエルジェ}...{enter}
From what I can tell,
it was you who attacked
first, wasn't it?{enter}
She had no choice but to
defend herself after you
took it upon yourself to
attack without permission.{enter}
Above all, you were meant
to be under Kelvena's
command. Were you obeying
Kelvena's orders?"

Miang
"You are not to prosecute
any soldier for treason
without proper authority.{enter}
Even if you both are
Elements.{wait:0A} Further{wait:05}...{wait:05}{enter}
Isn't your attitude toward
the lieutenant, nothing
more than your own
personal prejudice{wait:05}...{wait:05}{enter}
Or am I mistaken?"

#### 10 ####
Dominia
"What!?
I would never..."

#### 11 ####
Miang
"Thus far, we still cannot
determine whether or not
she is guilty of treason.{enter}
To investigate the truth
of this matter further, I
am placing the lieutenant
under my supervision.{enter}
Is that clear?"

#### 12 ####
Dominia
"How dare you!
By what authority!?"

#### 13 ####
Miang
"Let's go."
