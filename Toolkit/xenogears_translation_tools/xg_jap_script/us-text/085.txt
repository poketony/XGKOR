#### 1 ####
Margie
"Wow!
It's been such a long
time since I left here."

#### 2 ####
Citan
"Well...{enter}
First of all, we should
accompany Marguerite up
to meet the sisters!"

#### 3 ####
Bart
"...Huh?{wait:1E}
What is it old Maison?"

#### 4 ####
Maison
"Sniff...
Goodness gracious me...!{enter}
To think that little Miss
Marguerite was finally
able to return here...{enter}
...{wait:1E}
It is so awfully moving!"

#### 5 ####
Bart
"H...{wait:0A}hey!
Pull yourself together,
old man!"

#### 6 ####
Maison
"F...{wait:0A}forgive me.
How terribly embarrassing!{wait:0A}
I couldn't help it..."

#### 7 ####
Maison
"I...{enter}
I shall go back and give
some instructions to the
men left on the ship.{enter}
Please, young master,
go ahead and escort
Miss Marguerite up to
see the sisters.{enter}
...Excuse me now."

#### 8 ####
Bart
"Please, don't either of
you talk about this in
front of Margie...{enter}
She's only just got back
from her long time in
captivity...{enter}
I don't want her to have
to worry...
I want her to be happy 
for a little longer."

#### 9 ####
Citan
"You should not be overly
worried yourself!{enter}
You have just got to think
about what is best for the
future of this land...{enter}
What is done is done!
You only did what you
believed was right...
Put the past behind you."

#### 10 ####
Bart
"Huh...
I'm alright!"

#### 11 ####
  Sigurd
  "Etrenank, the captial
  of the Solaris empire is
  located in the skies above.{enter}
  Solaris is separated from
  the land by dimensional
  distortion fields known
  as 'Gates'.{enter}
  Passing between the two
  requires special means of
  transportation...{wait:1E}
  such as an airship."

#### 12 ####
  Sigurd
  "We were placed in key
  military positions by
  Ramsus...{enter}
  And thanks to that, we came
  to know the relationship
  between Solaris and the
  surface dwellers."

#### 13 ####
  Bart
  "The...{wait:1E}'Lambs'...right?

#### 14 ####
       Sigurd
       "They weren't just using us
       'Lambs' for slave labor...{enter}
       They also selected some of
       us, like me, to be used as
       subjects in experiments to
       refine their drugs...{enter}
       Drugs that change people's
       personalities, to make them
       more aggressive and to draw
       out their latent abilities.{enter}
       They were using us as human
       guinea pigs to test their
       psychological alteration
       drugs!"

#### 15 ####
  Bart
  "Human guinea pigs...!?
  Experimenting on humans?"

#### 16 ####
  Sigurd
  "Yes, for example...

#### 17 ####
               'Drive'

#### 18 ####
     That drug, and all others
     like it that are used
     now, are by-products of
     human experimentation..."

#### 19 ####
     Citan
     "However, the role of such
     experimental subjects was
     not limited to just that!"

#### 20 ####
Citan
"There is a new wind
blowing today..."

#### 21 ####
Sigurd
"Well, we will go ahead
and prepare the ship for
launch."

#### 22 ####
The town representatives
have been meeting at the
assembly hall since this
morning.

#### 23 ####
I hear it is because
Marguerite has returned...{enter}
They are trying to decide
how to deal with Aveh as
the 'Nisan parish'.

#### 24 ####
I can understand why
everyone is worried.{enter}
But the Great Mother
has finally returned...{enter}
We should be celebrating,
shouldn't we?

#### 25 ####
Margie
"These are the people
who took care of me
when I was small."

#### 26 ####
Margie
"I won't be able to call
you 'young master' the
next time I see you.{enter}
It'll probably have to
be 'Your Majesty'{wait:05}...{wait:0A}
But it doesn't quite
sound right, does it?"

#### 27 ####
Bart
"Whatever...
It doesn't matter."

#### 28 ####
Maison
"The people of Nisan were
most generous to allow us
to rent this house.{enter}
So there will be no need
to seek lodgings at the
inn for a while.{enter}
Also, Master Sigurd
wishes a word with you
regarding your next move,
if he may..."

#### 29 ####
Bart
"Alright...
So where is Sig?"

#### 30 ####
Maison
"The good Master Sigurd is
 waiting for you inside."

#### 31 ####
Bart
"Okay, thanks Maison."

#### 32 ####
Maison
"Master Sigurd awaits
you inside, sir..."

#### 33 ####
Bart
"Ah!"

#### 34 ####
Maison
"Yo-ung ma--ste-r!"

#### 35 ####
Bart
"I had no idea Sig 
had such a past..."

#### 36 ####
Citan
"Are you still
suspicious of
Sigurd...?"

#### 37 ####
Bart
"Well...I mean...
it was just so sudden.{enter}
I kind of expected to hear
something different...
like that we were childhood
rivals or something...{enter}
But that's nothing compared
to the story he just told
us, is it?"

#### 38 ####
Citan
"Hmm.{wait:1E} So hearing his story
has you confused because it
was not so simple...{enter}
There was a time when he
was cooperating with one
of Gebler's generals...{enter}
Furthermore, behind Gebler
was a country that you had
never even heard of..."

#### 39 ####
Bart
"Hey, what are you
picking on me for?"

#### 40 ####
Citan
"No I am not picking on you
or blaming anything on you.
What I am saying is this...{enter}
If you think about how he
feels, then you should see
why he could not talk about
this with you till now."

#### 41 ####
Citan
"Looking at the activities
of Solaris toward other
countries up until now...{enter}
...It has never gone
beyond simply maintaining
their own empire, or
'self-preservation'.{enter}
And as you have seen, their
military power is immense.
So Sigurd was probably
thinking ahead...{enter}
First he was probably
concentrating on taking
care of the problems here
on the continent of Ignas.{enter}
Once things were settled
here, it would give him
a stronger foundation to
deal with Solaris later.{enter}
Which is a much better plan
than rushing straight into
a war he knew we could not
win. Quite logical, really.

#### 42 ####
Bart
"Sounds like you understand
one another pretty well."

#### 43 ####
Citan
"Well it is not like we are
newly acquainted, is it?{enter}
And we had talked about a
lot of things up until we
decided to escape from
Solaris."

#### 44 ####
Bart
"Speaking of that...
Why did you leave?{enter}
That Ramsus guy was
supposed to be a 'Star
of Hope' or something,
wasn't he?"

#### 45 ####
Citan
"Yes, I certainly thought
so at first.{enter}
But then I realized his way
of thinking really was not
that much of a change from
the previous system.{enter}
Basically, the only
difference was whether they
stressed people's rank and
class, or their skill.{enter}
The words had changed, but
it was still no different
from what Solaris itself
had been doing until then.{enter}
He had no intentions of
bringing everyone a
better way of life."

#### 46 ####
Bart
"In other words, he's an
elitist. I don't think
I like him much either."

#### 47 ####
Bart
"So, Citan...{wait:1E}
Do you think I can
beat Gebler?"

#### 48 ####
Citan
"Why? Are you planning
on fighting them?"

#### 49 ####
Bart
"As long as they're
working with Shakhan,
there's no way around it.{enter}
The way things are going,
I'm sure we'll have to
fight them sooner or
later."

#### 50 ####
Citan
"Hmm...
I suppose so, but...{enter}
Even if we were to defeat
the Gebler forces here,
there is still Solaris,
to deal with.{enter}
If we are not careful, it
is possible that we may get
involved in a longer war
than that with Shakhan.{enter}
Do you not agree that
continuing the way we
have been going is rather
hard on everyone?{enter}
I think it is time we
try to get help from
a greater number of
people."

#### 51 ####
Bart
"So defeating Shakhan's
not going to get rid of
the likes of Gebler..."

#### 52 ####
Bart
"I know what you're
trying to say...{enter}
'To vanquish Gebler,
first gain thy throne!'
...Right?"

#### 53 ####
Citan
"Hmm...
You could put it that way."

#### 54 ####
Bart
"What do you mean...
'You could put it that
way'?{enter}
But then again, maybe it
is time I did something
about that."

#### 55 ####
This road leads
to the cathedral.

#### 56 ####
Oh, Bart!
I'm glad you're well.

#### 57 ####
I've already contacted the
monastery.{enter}
Please take Margie up
there as soon as possible.{enter}
She'll be so happy...
not to mention the sisters!

#### 58 ####
Margie
"I must hurry and
see the sisters."

#### 59 ####
I've already contacted
the monastery.{enter}
Go to them quickly and
show them you're alright.{enter}
I'm sure they'll be
happy to see you!

#### 60 ####
Welcome back!

#### 61 ####
The people at the hidden
port contacted us just
before you came into town.

#### 62 ####
I'm so glad you're safe!

#### 63 ####
My dad always says,
"It's peaceful here."...{enter}
But what is 'peace' anyway?
I don't really understand.

#### 64 ####
Mr. Pirate!

#### 65 ####
Will you let me ride
in your ship someday?

#### 66 ####
Bart
"Hahaha!
Maybe when you get a
little older, kid!"

#### 67 ####
Are bad people
coming to get us?

#### 68 ####
Hey, you're a stranger,
aren't you?{enter}
My mom said that there
are lots of strangers
who do bad things, so
I should be careful.{enter}
Are you a bad person?

#### 69 ####
Margie has come back!

#### 70 ####
My dad was saying that
there was going to be
a war, so we should
move somewhere else.

#### 71 ####
How's my young lord going?

#### 72 ####
Bart
"Don't call me
'young lord'!"

#### 73 ####
(Oh! I forgot...{wait:0A}
Your true identity is
supposed to be a secret.{enter}
There's only a handful
of people in this town
who know who you are...{enter}
I'll be more careful,
my young lord!{wait:1E}
...{wait:1E}Oops.)

#### 74 ####
If it isn't my young lord!
I hear you gave them quite
a show this time!

#### 75 ####
Bart
(Shhh! Keep it down!
My true identity is
supposed to be a secret!{enter}
What if a spy from the
Royal Capital snuck in
here and heard you!?)

#### 76 ####
(Oh... I hadn't
thought about that!)

#### 77 ####
My young lord!
I've heard that the
time has finally come.{enter}
But now I won't be
able to call you my
young lord anymore...
...Your Majesty!

#### 78 ####
Bart
"Well...{wait:1E}let's keep it as
young lord.{wait:0A} 'Your Majesty'
is going a bit too far!{enter}
Not that I'm suited to,
or like to be called,
either title anyway!"

#### 79 ####
How are you,
my young lord?{enter}
I knew you'd come
back in one piece!

#### 80 ####
Are you a pilgrim?
Young pilgrims like
you are very rare.

#### 81 ####
How is my young lord?{enter}
I knew you'd all
come back alive!

#### 82 ####
You're friends of my young
lord, right? Since you are
friends with him, I'm sure
you already know, but...{enter}
He'll be the leader of this
country one day!
I had a chance to take care
of him when he was small.{enter}
That's why I call him my
'young lord'.
Please look after him for
me!

#### 83 ####
You should try new things
while you're still young!{enter}
If you don't expand your
horizons, you'll regret
it when you get old.

#### 84 ####
So you're going to make
your move eh, Bartholomew?{enter}
But somehow I don't think
that man's just going to
stand by and let you do
as you please though.

#### 85 ####
Fei
"That man?"

#### 86 ####
Bart
"He means 'Shakhan'!"

#### 87 ####
Yes.
It's alright to try and
avenge your father...{enter}
...but I don't think
things will be that
easy, though!

#### 88 ####
Bart
"I don't want to
hurt anyone.{enter}
I want you to know
I'm always thinking
about that."

#### 89 ####
Do your best!

#### 90 ####
Do your best!

#### 91 ####
You should try new things
while you're still young!{enter}
If you don't expand your
horizons, you'll regret
it when you get old.

#### 92 ####
I've had enough troubles.
I just want to live life
peacefully.

#### 93 ####
You must be from another land.
How's the outside world?{enter}
Rumor has it that political
instability is growing...{enter}
But that's hardly surprising,
given the current governments.

#### 94 ####
So it has finally begun.
My late father always said,
"Don't miss the greater
happiness by being misled
by minor sufferings."!{enter}
It hurts me to see our
children placed in danger.
But if it moves our country
in the right direction,
then it's in their benefit.

#### 95 ####
Ahh, it's such a nice day.

#### 96 ####
Oh, so you're the ones?
Everyone in town is
talking about you!{enter}
Something about the
Great Mother returning...{enter}
Since they call her the
Great Mother she must
be really old and frail!

#### 97 ####
I had no idea...
Why, the Great Mother
is younger than I am!?{enter}
I'm new here, so I don't
know much...{enter}
I don't know exactly what
is going on, but let's just
avoid any trouble now, okay!?

#### 98 ####
This land...
extends aaaaall the way
around the lake...{enter}
Which extends aaaaall the
way around the cathedral.{enter}
Just for fun, you might
want to go aaaaall the
way around it yourself.{enter}
Not that there's much to
see at aaaaall, mind you.

#### 99 ####
It does the heart good
to see the innocent
play of children.

#### 100 ####
Most of the families with
children have evacuated.{enter}
They were afraid of getting
caught up in a battle here.{enter}
It's so lonely now.
How I miss them...

#### 101 ####
No matter where you
go in this world,
war is everywhere.{enter}
This town could be the
only place that isn't
involved in conflict.

#### 102 ####
The town representatives
have been in discussion
at the assembly hall
since this morning.

#### 103 ####
I hear they're talking
about a plan to deal with
the troops from Aveh.{enter}
Some of them think the
return of Margie is a
nuisance.

#### 104 ####
I can understand why
everyone is worried.{enter}
But shouldn't we be counting
our blessings that the Great
Mother resides in Nisan...?

#### 105 ####
The town representatives have
finished their discussions
and are moving into action.{enter}
They have dispersed to
prepare their defenses and
accommodations for the
residents desiring to escape.

#### 106 ####
May heaven protect you all.

#### 107 ####
Neither of us serve
heaven within the
Nisan cathedral...{enter}
But we pray here daily,
as ones who have lived
here for many years.

#### 108 ####
May all things be
as heaven wills...

#### 109 ####
God bless you. And I wish
you good fortune too.

#### 110 ####
I'll get you!

#### 111 ####
I'm gonna get you!

#### 112 ####
Outta the way,
outta the way!

#### 113 ####
Outta the way!
Outta the way!

#### 114 ####
Outta the way,
outta the way!

#### 115 ####
Outta the way!
Outta the way!

#### 116 ####
 Studio 

#### 117 ####
They're continuing their
discussion in there.

#### 118 ####
"...?"
