Maison
"...sob...sob...
Oh to think that Marguerite
has now returned...{enter}
Come to think of it, this
is the second time we have
had to flee from the Royal
Capital.{enter}
It seems an awful long
time ago...
That night that I took
them with me to escape..."

#### 2 ####
Bart
"Yeah and on top of that he
was bold enough to steal
this ship along the way.{enter}
You know this used to be
the kingdom's flagship?"

#### 3 ####
Maison
"Yes, it was all Sigurd's
doing.{wait:0A} So courageous of him
even at such a young age.{enter}
Anyway, this Yggdrasil can
be considered as a keepsake
of the late king for the
young master."

#### 4 ####
Bart
"It kinda feels like you're
stuck to me for life.{enter}
Even though you used to be
my personal knight, right?
Now I'm just a kid pirate!"

#### 5 ####
Maison
"But eventually you will
become a proud lord."

#### 6 ####
Bart
"I gotta hurry up and
grow up or I'll never
be proud of myself.{enter}
And I won't be able
to win against him!"

#### 7 ####
Maison
"..."

#### 8 ####
Masion
"Oh, aren't you going
to rest up a little?"

#### 9 ####
Maison
"It appears the final
hour is approaching...{enter}
If need be, this Maison
will also take up arms
and come to your aid!!"

#### 10 ####
Maison
"We may not be able to come
along, but will be praying
for your safety."

#### 11 ####
Maison
"...
I have nothing to look
back on that I regret!"

#### 12 ####
Maison
"My, hasn't it gotten
lively around here."

#### 13 ####
Maison
"Do be careful now..."

#### 14 ####
Maison
"Master Billy is
waiting for you
over yonder..."

#### 15 ####
Maison
"A mature yet modern
atmosphere... That is
what I offer you...{enter}
A bartender's life isn't
all that bad you know!"

#### 16 ####
Maison
"For people from a heathen
nation like us to receive
such charity...{enter}
My word, god is so very,
very tolerant...

#### 17 ####
Maison
"Miss Elly...
and then Master Fei...{enter}
Why do we continue to have
misfortunes like this?"

#### 18 ####
Maison
"Miss Elly...{wait:0A}
What kind of spell
was used on her?"

#### 19 ####
Maison
"Y...young master!{wait:0A}
I heard all about it.{enter}
International amity
with the Thames!?{wait:0A}
Indeed..."

#### 20 ####
(...Sob...sob...{wait:0A}
This old man's efforts
weren't all wasted!)

#### 21 ####
Maison
"I have no idea where we
are.{wait:0A} It's not on the map, 
either..."

#### 22 ####
Maison
"Oh! Doctor Uzuki.{wait:0A}
I'm sorry to put you
out so much...{enter}
We should've stopped
the young master...{wait:0A}
I am terribly sorry!"

#### 23 ####
(Uh{wait:05}...uh{wait:05}...uh...{wait:05}...{wait:05}!{wait:0A}
My chronic lumbago has
gotten worse since
I hustled in Aveh...)

#### 24 ####
Maison
"At long last we are
heading to Bledavik
tomorrow...{enter}
Though he is the prince,
our young master doesn't
know the Royal Capital
very well{wait:05}...{enter}
I'd always felt that was
an awful pity. But despite
that, I tried my best to
raise him as Crown Prince.{enter}
However, looking back, I
might have put too much of
the 'burdens of kingship'
on him too early in life...{enter}
And it might have been too
much for a child with a
future like his to handle.
{wait:05}...{enter}
I must be the most
terrible minder ever!"

#### 25 ####
Citan
"My dear Lord Maison...{wait:0A}
I hardly think that
is right!{enter}
The young one would have
taken the burden off of
himself had he not wanted
to bear it any longer!{enter}
He is a fine man now...
far capable of handling
any such burdens or
pressures.{enter}
And I believe you are
the very ones who have
given him the strength
to do so."

#### 26 ####
Maison
"Oh my good
Doctor Uzuki..."

#### 27 ####
Maison
"Let us head for Aveh.{wait:0A}
To save Miss Marguerite!!"

#### 28 ####
Maison
"I hope you are not
too taken back?{enter}
Lately, there are far too
many barbaria{wait:0A}...{wait:05} I mean...{wait:05}
highly energetic lads,
around the young master.{enter}
So, yours truly, who is
in charge of education,
demanded to have this
room created!!"

#### 29 ####
(But, because of that,
I ended up having to
take a side job...)

#### 30 ####
"How may I be of service?"
{fast:FF}    Items
    Weapons/Accessories
    Nothing now, thanks.

#### 31 ####
"How may I be of service?"
{fast:FF}    Items

"How may I be of service?"
{fast:FF}    Items
    Weapons/Accessories
    Nothing now, thanks.

#### 33 ####
Maison
"I hope I can be of
such service again!"

#### 34 ####
Maison
"{fast:02}Oh, young master...!
If the young master doesn't
come here more often to
receive an education fit for
a prince, then old Maison,
who is in charge of his
upbringing, will disgrace
the very memory of King
Edbart IV... god bless him.
Typical of the young master
not to even listen to me!
The king was peace-loving,
a very generous person...
On the contrary, not only
does the young master, put
his name on a missile, but
goes and shoots an unknown
airplane with it.
To make the matters worse,
his good friend Fei and
company were onboard it..."

#### 35 ####
Maison
"Anyway, one must apologize
to Doctor Uzuki and his
friend Master Rico, right!?{enter}
They were on their way
toward the Gear Hangar..."

#### 36 ####
Citan
"I am sure Elly is alive
and well.{wait:0A} If we just go on
believing it...!"

#### 37 ####
Citan
"I would be more than
happy to come along!!"

#### 38 ####
Citan
"No one can stop our
old friend now...!"

#### 39 ####
Citan
"I would be more than
happy to come along!!"

#### 40 ####
Citan
"Young one,{wait:0A}
I see you got on well with
the captain of the Thames.{enter}
I guess that was expected.{wait:0A}
He is a man of the sea,
the type of person you
would admire..."

#### 41 ####
Sigurd
"...{wait:0A}
Oh, yes... It's time for
you to depart, right.{enter}
I'm sorry, old friend,
but I have a job I must
do..."

#### 42 ####
Jessie
"Oh god, is it that time
already?{wait:0A} Well then, before
we go let's do the usual...{enter}
You know...{wait:05} the 'paint the
face on your stomach and
dance around trick'...?{wait:05}
The three of us together!"

#### 43 ####
Citan
"!!{wait:0A}
Well, actually, we are
in a hurry so, errh...{enter}
We will talk about that
some other time..."

#### 44 ####
Jessie
"Oh? Is that right?{wait:0A}
Well then, I oughta get
outta here too, huh!"

#### 45 ####
Citan
"There is something I
want to ask you too...{enter}
So let us get together
when we have more
time...!"

#### 46 ####
Jessie
"Yeah.{wait:0A}
I hope I live to have
the opportunity..."

#### 47 ####
Citan
"..."

#### 48 ####
CRASH!!!{clear:0F}

#### 49 ####
Elly
"AAAAAAHHHHH!!{wait:0A}
Sigurd is...!"

#### 50 ####
Citan
"Again!?{wait:0A}
Sigurd gets drunk so
easily...!{enter}
Well that blows it!
We cannot leave today,{wait:0A}
perhaps tomorrow..."

#### 51 ####
Sigurd
"..."

#### 52 ####
Jessie
"The keywords are Nikolai,{wait:0A}
Maria, {wait:0A}
a huge Gear{wait:0A}...{wait:05} eh!?"

#### 53 ####
Jessie
"Hah...!{wait:0A} Just goes to show
the kid needs his parents
around him all the time!"

#### 54 ####
Jessie
"Ha, ha, ha!!
I haven't hit the booze
for a long while!{enter}
It's all cause my son
doesn't let me drink! {wait:0A}
This is a great bar you've
got here... old codger!"

#### 55 ####
Maison
"Why... errh,
thank you,
my good man."

#### 56 ####
Jessie
"This old codger, has good
character...{wait:0A}like his booze!{wait:0A}
I like him!! Ha, ha, ha!"

#### 57 ####
Ha, ha, ha! {clear:0A}

#### 58 ####
Ha, ha, ha! {clear:0A}

Shevat Agent
"Originally, Shevat was a
town situated on top of
'Babel Tower'...{enter}
They say there was a
communication facility
to contact what now is
Shevat on top of the tower.{enter}
If only it still exists
and still works now..."

#### 60 ####
Phew! I no longer have
to listen to the roars
of the old man any more.

#### 61 ####
The engine's restoration
is finally finished.{enter}
Why don't you go down
the stairs to take a look
at our beautiful engine.

#### 62 ####
Billy
"It was a long journey...{wait:0A}
But what we did was not
in vain. Let's prove it!"

#### 63 ####
Billy
"I want to journey with
you and find out the
truth about this world!!{enter}
You can count on me to
help you anytime!"

#### 64 ####
Sigurd
"...{wait:0A}
Now I see why you came
down to the surface...{enter}
Alright, I understand you.
But Kahran Ramsus...
taking over the post of
Aveh is pretty annoying."

#### 65 ####
Citan
"The home country
might have had some
special reasons."

#### 66 ####
Sigurd
"Yeah...{wait:0A}
obviously."

#### 67 ####
Citan
"But perhaps there is still
a chance of success...{enter}
You and I, who used to be
called 'Elements' at the
commander's training school
'Jugend', are both here!"

#### 68 ####
Sigurd
"Hope you are right..."

#### 69 ####
Citan
"By the way, 
she is still...?"

#### 70 ####
Sigurd
"According to Fei,
there was a female aide
on Kahr's side...{enter}
And he said that she had
Indigo blue eyes and hair.
... 
So it must be her..."

#### 71 ####
Citan
"So all the old 'Elements'
members are on the surface
world now..."

#### 72 ####
Sigurd
"I guess so..."

#### 73 ####
Sigurd
"Hyuga{wait:05}...{wait:0A}
To be honest with you{wait:05}...{wait:05}
she scares me.{enter}
She supports Kahr and
is kind to anyone, 
I know that very well.{enter}
But sometimes I felt
a strange fear in her.
That bothers me more than
Kahr being in this land."

#### 74 ####
Citan
"That cannot be true...
Not in her..."

#### 75 ####
Sigurd
"Yeah, I don't want to 
believe it, either...{enter}
But don't you remember how
I could always sense these
things quite accurately?"

#### 76 ####
Citan
"Right..."

#### 77 ####
Citan
"By the way, have you told
the young one yet...?"

#### 78 ####
Sigurd
"No, not yet.{enter}
I don't want him to worry
until we know exactly what
Solaris' objectives really
are.{enter}
But I have to tell him 
eventually though...{wait:0A}
Anyway, Hyuga, have you
gotten any information?"

#### 79 ####
Citan
"Not really....{wait:0A}
I left there before going
into the center section..."

#### 80 ####
(Fei!!){clear:1E}

#### 81 ####
Fei
(Oh, it's you Bart!?{wait:0A}
Don't scare me...!)

#### 82 ####
Bart
(Sorry-dorry.{enter}
It sounds like Sig and your
doctor friend know each
other pretty darn well...{enter}
Sig{wait:05}...{wait:05}
Damn, I thought I knew
everything about that
guy!)

#### 83 ####
Fei
(When did doc get back..?)

#### 84 ####
Jessie
"I see.{wait:0A}
This is the place you
begged to return to, eh?"

#### 85 ####
Sigurd
"Well, yes..."

#### 86 ####
Jessie
"After you left,
Billy cried a lot."

#### 87 ####
Sigurd
"...{wait:0A}
I'm sorry."

#### 88 ####
Citan
"When you left Solaris,
the same thing happened.{wait:0A}
Kahr was quite upset then."

#### 89 ####
Sigurd
"I didn't mean to
betray him..."

#### 90 ####
Citan
"His misanthropy has
gotten even worse
because of that."

#### 91 ####
Citan
"Now, enough about old
times, old friend.{enter}
I did not expect to
find you loitering in
this land..."

#### 92 ####
Everyone!

#### 93 ####
Billy
"Good morning.{enter}
They said you were still
sleeping, so I went
ahead and came in."

#### 94 ####
Bart
"You're dressed lightly.
Is that enough?"

#### 95 ####
Rico
"You're dressed lightly.
Is that enough?"

#### 96 ####
Billy
"We Etones have some
rather unique equipment.{enter}
Let me explain about the
equipment since we're 
going to be working
together."

#### 97 ####
Billy
"First of all, my basic
equipment are guns.
There're three kinds...{enter}
'Handgun',{wait:0A}
'Ether-gun',{wait:0A}
and 'Big-gun'.{enter}
The handgun is the only one
that can be replaced with
other versions of the same
kind.{enter}
I made the other two kinds
of guns myself, so there
are no others to replace
them with.{enter}
You can power-up a gun's
attack force by changing
its 'ammo' or 'bullets'
with more powerful ones!{enter}
To load ammo, press Right
or Left on the Directional
button at the Equip Menu
Screen.{enter}
This will display a sub-
window in place of the
main Equip window, where
you can select your ammo.{enter}
One thing you have to be
careful of is that the
number of bullets for
each gun is limited.{enter}
To successfully manage your
ammo, you must keep an
ample supply and reload
frequently!{enter}
But now that I have said
this, note that Ether-guns
do not have such a limit.{wait:14}
Well that's about it...{enter}
Did you understand?
    {fast:FF}Yes
    No, please explain again{wait:0A}

#### 98 ####
Bart
"I understood it roughly.
But it's a bit complicated,
isn't it?"

#### 99 ####
Rico
"...I see.{wait:0A}
That's very unique..."

#### 100 ####
Billy
"...{wait:05}This is a fine gun
indeed.{wait:0A} I'm sure it has
a significant history."

#### 101 ####
Bart
"Of course!{enter}
It's the famous rifle
'Machiganater', handed down
in the Fatima family."

#### 102 ####
Billy
"What a waste...{wait:0A}
It's too good for you who
just brandishes a whip..."

#### 103 ####
Bart
"Hey!{wait:0A}
Why are you getting
sharp with me!?"

#### 104 ####
Billy
"Oh, sorry...{wait:0A} It's just...{wait:0A}
I didn't think you would
have an interest in guns."

#### 105 ####
Elly
"Well anyway...{wait:0A}
Billy...{enter}
I'd like to know why you
became an Etone..."

#### 106 ####
Bart
(I'm not interested...){clear:1E}

#### 107 ####
Billy
"...{enter}
Hmm, I see...
Etones help out strangers,
so I suppose that would
make you curious..."

#### 108 ####
Elly
"No, I don't mean that.{wait:0A}
I'm curious about your own 
intentions, personally.{enter}
I don't know...
I just didn't expect you
to be an Etone at all..."

#### 109 ####
...

#### 110 ####
Billy
"I see...{enter}
Well, since our job is
rather unusual, I'll tell
you about that too as I
explain..."

#### 111 ####
Bart
"...{wait:0A}
Looks like we've
made it already..."

#### 112 ####
Citan
"...{wait:0A}
It looks like we
have arrived..."

#### 113 ####
Billy
"Can it be...?{wait:0A}
The transport ship's being
attacked by Reapers..."

#### 114 ####
...

#### 115 ####
...

#### 116 ####
Billy
"Can anyone help us?"

#### 117 ####
Billy
"Hah!
This is going to sound
pathetic, but...{enter}
I almost went so far as
to sell my body to support
Prim, since we only had
each other for so long...{enter}
Despite that, Prim still
prefers the father that she
never knew... The one who
suddenly appeared out of
nowhere..."

#### 118 ####
Bart
"'Almost sold your body'!?
Don't you know, kid...!?{enter}
There're things you can
get back once sold, and
there are things you just
can't!{enter}
Couldn't you see that!?"

#### 119 ####
Billy
"Of course I refrained.{wait:0A}
But they said they'd give
me 3000G for one night..."

#### 120 ####
Bart
"You fool!{wait:0A} Listen...{wait:0A} Next
time you and your sister
need help, come to my ship.{enter}
We're self-sufficient, so
at least you don't need to
worry about food and a
place to sleep!{enter}
Now, don't you ever say
'sell your body' in front
of me ever again...!{wait:0A}
You understand!?"

#### 121 ####
Billy
"Could this be...?{wait:0A}
Maybe you are a 'nice
guy' after all...?"

#### 122 ####
Bart
"Why don't you just
come out and say
'thank you'?{wait:0A} Geez!"

#### 123 ####
Billy
"Uh...{wait:0A}errh...{wait:0A}well...{wait:0A}
you haven't taken care of
us yet,{wait:0A} so I won't say it!"

#### 124 ####
Cute, kid, REAL cute!

#### 125 ####
Elly
"'Sold your body'{wait:0A}...?

#### 126 ####
Billy
"Of course I refrained
from actually doing it.{enter}
But they said they'd
give me 3000G a night..."

#### 127 ####
Elly
"..."

#### 128 ####
Jessie
"When I was in Solaris, I
found out about the secret
plan...{enter}
That was the 'Malakh' (M)
Plan.{wait:14}
And it was done under the
command of Krelian...{enter}
In order to proceed with
the plan, many Lambs were
gathered by the 'Ethos',
to become guinea pigs.{enter}
Or, should I say, to become
Reapers or -Wels-..."

#### 129 ####
Jessie
"Since I was disgusted with
Solaris' methods, I decided
to investigate it further.{enter}
I found out that the main
scientist central to the M
Plan moved the true facts
about it into a test-Gear.{enter}
Then he let that test-Gear
escape with his daughter,{wait:05}
so that the truth would
not be discovered...{enter}
And that,{wait:05} I'm afraid,{wait:05} was
the last information that
I was able to obtain..."

#### 130 ####
Jessie
"Because of what I found
out, I came down to the
surface world...{enter}
And this is where I hid,
along with my wife,
Racquel, and son Billy.{enter}
I've been looking for
that Gear and the girl
ever since."

#### 131 ####
Jessie
"Finally,{wait:0A} I found out that
the scientist's daughter
and Gear may be in Shevat.{enter}
All very well, except now
I don't know how in blazes
to get there, or even how
to contact the place.{enter}
Well, Shevat is protected
by a strong barrier that
even Solaris can't do
anything about...{enter}
So I guess you can say
it can't be helped...{wait:0A}
It's just my luck!"

#### 132 ####
That girl's name
wouldn't happen
to be Maria...?

#### 133 ####
Billy
"Oh, are you two alright?{wait:0A}
Shouldn't you get some
more rest...?"

#### 134 ####
Shevat Agent
"Yes, I can stand and
can even walk now...
Thank you."

#### 135 ####
Fei
"I'm alright, too."

#### 136 ####
Jessie
"Maria, eh...?{wait:0A} Hmm...{wait:0A}
If I remember right, her
father's name was Nikolai?"

#### 137 ####
Shevat Agent
"I don't know that much...{wait:0A}
But I have heard rumors
about a girl and a Gear."

#### 138 ####
Jessie
"Hmm,{wait:0A} it's got to be them.{wait:0A}
So that huge Gear is in
Shevat then!"

#### 139 ####
Jessie
"So then...{wait:0A} how can we get
to this Shevat? Is there a
way to contact the place?"

#### 140 ####
Shevat Agent 
"Unfortunately since I was
taken captive I have no way
of contacting them either."

#### 141 ####
I see...

#### 142 ####
!!{clear:1E}

#### 143 ####
Shevat Agent
"There just may be a way...!
Originally, Shevat was
situated on top of
Babel Tower.{enter}
They say there is a
communication facility to
contact Shevat's native
country on top of the tower.{wait:0A} 
If only it still exists..."

#### 144 ####
Citan
"Hmm...{enter}
There is a good
possibility the
facility may have
been destroyed...{enter}
Especially when you
consider the fact
that the tower was
sealed by the 'Ethos'."

#### 145 ####
Jessie
"You're being
pessimistic again..."

#### 146 ####
Citan
"I am just being
realistic."

#### 147 ####
...

#### 148 ####
Bart
"I guess we have no choice
but try and go there.{enter}
As long as the gate exists,
we can't escape from
Solaris' influence anyway.{enter}
In other words, even if we
recover Aveh from Shakhan,
it wouldn't immediatley be
a happy ending."

#### 149 ####
Billy
"I think we have no
choice but to try
and go there...{enter}
Either way, as long
as the gate exists we
can't escape from the
shadow of Solaris."

#### 150 ####
Citan
"Their 'secret plan' 
bothers me, too...{enter}
The real secret is that
they are using humans
gathered from earth..."

#### 151 ####
Fei
"But I don't quite get this{wait:05}
secret plan{wait:05} and {wait:05}the 'Ethos'
involvement{wait:05} and so on...{enter}
What in the hell does
Solaris think us surface
dwelling humans are!?"

#### 152 ####
Fei
"...Sorry.{wait:0A}
I totally forgot that it
was your country..."

#### 153 ####
Elly
"What my country's doing...{wait:0A}
has nothing to do with me.{enter}
I myself thought something
was wrong there, and that's
why I came here...{wait:0A}
So, don't worry about me.

#### 154 ####
Fei
"We've got nothing to lose,
so let's try to go there.{enter}
We need to find the truth
about those documents found
in the 'Ethos' H.Q. and
what Billy's father said.{enter}
And I must go to Shevat
too for my own personal
reasons anyway."

#### 155 ####
Fei
"No time like the present,
huh!?{wait:0A} Let's go to Babel
Tower right away!"

#### 156 ####
