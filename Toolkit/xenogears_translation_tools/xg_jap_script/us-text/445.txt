Fei
"What're you going to do
to me...?"

#### 2 ####
As I suspected.
You know nothing...!

#### 3 ####
Fei
"Doc!! {wait:0A}Citan,
why are you here!?"

#### 4 ####
Citan
"I saw Bart's image on
the Birdvision in the
dedication."

#### 5 ####
Fei
"You saw that too, doc?"

#### 6 ####
Citan
"Yes.{wait:0A} But I did not
see either of you.{enter}
Soon after, I heard
there was an intruder
at the 2nd floor of
the Arebato Grounds.{enter}
I suspected
it was probably you
so I waited here.{enter}
After that,
I did not hear anything
about the capture of
any intruders."

#### 7 ####
Fei
"How did you know I was
going to be here?"

#### 8 ####
Citan
"The best possible way to
sneak into the Palace
is through the dust chute.{enter}
And to get back to
the 3rd floor, one must
pass through this
observation tower.{enter}
I have always
been thinking{wait:05}...{wait:05}{enter}
Do you think you could
possibly be a little more
subtle?{enter}
When infiltrating
enemy ground, the most
basic thing to do is to
be stealthy.{enter}
With the amount of
activity you have stirred
up, you could even wake
up the dead."

#### 9 ####
Fei
"Well, I was actually
trying to be subtle..."

#### 10 ####
Citan
"By the way, what
happened to Elly?{wait:0A}
Was she not with you?"

#### 11 ####
Fei
"Elly...{wait:0A} She went back
home.{enter}
She really shouldn't have
any relation with us land
dwellers.{enter}
She already has such
wonderful parents..."

#### 12 ####
Citan
"I see...{wait:0A}{enter}
Yes. It may have been
better for her that
way. Let us head for
the dust chute then."

#### 13 ####
Yeah!{clear:1E}

#### 14 ####
Citan
"Now Fei,{wait:0A} stay very close
to me.{enter}
That way it does not pick
up on your presence."

#### 15 ####
?{wait:05}?

#### 16 ####
Fei
"Doc, hold on. 
How can you get 
past here?{enter}
According to Elly, only
1st Class citizens
and military personnel
can pass through...?"

#### 17 ####
Citan
"Uh!?{wait:14} Well{wait:0A}...{wait:0A}that is...{enter}
P,{wait:0A} probably they have not
deleted my ID from the days
I was in the military {enter}
and it is still stored
in the data bank."

#### 18 ####
My, how the Solaris
monitors are sloppy...{wait:0A}
Hahaha...

#### 19 ####
Fei
"{wait:05}...{wait:05}??"
