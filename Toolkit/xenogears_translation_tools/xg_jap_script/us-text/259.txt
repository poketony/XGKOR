Bart
"...So if we destroy that
Zohar thing, everything
will be over, right?"

#### 2 ####
Citan
"Yes.{enter}
The source of our Ether
powers, and the source of
power for the generators
that make our Gears work...{enter}
It all comes from the
'Zohar Modifier' engine
which can control any
potential phenomena.{enter}
If we destroy it,{wait:05}
Deus...{wait:05}
and the -Seraph- angels...{wait:05}
will all be deactivated...{enter}
And then we should also be
able to free Elly, who has
become bound to the Deus
weapon system as 'Miang'."

#### 3 ####
Right, Fei?

#### 4 ####
Fei
"Yeah.
That's what the 'Wave
Existence' said."

#### 5 ####
Citan
"But then there is the
downside...{enter}
It will also mean that we
will no longer be able to
use our Gears or our Ether
powers anymore."

#### 6 ####
Rico
"What are those -Seraph-
angels all about anyway?{enter}
That odd appearance as if
they lack something...{wait:05}as if
they were neither living
beings nor mere weapons..."

#### 7 ####
Citan
"Zohar senses the human
consciousness and
incarnates the -Seraphs-."

#### 8 ####
Billy
"Human consciousness...?"

#### 9 ####
Citan
"Zohar itself involves the
principle of uncertainty.{enter}
The observer's perception
of Zohar determines the
entity it actually becomes.{enter}
In other words, I believe
that those angels are
incarnations of the
spirits of people...{enter}
...The people who have
been absorbed by Deus to
become parts of it."

#### 10 ####
Bart
"So what merit is there for
them to gain in eliminating
all of civilization?"

#### 11 ####
Maria
"Is it some kind of hatred
for those humans who have
survived?"

#### 12 ####
Citan
"Of course not.{enter}
Those people who were
created and assimilated
as parts for Deus would
not have such intentions.{enter}
Try to remember what
Elly, when she became
Miang, said."

#### 13 ####
Fei
" 'The creations of god
   will someday be a
   hindrance...{enter}
   That is why they must
   be eliminated...'"

#### 14 ####
Citan
"Yes. That is why Merkava
is being used to begin the
destruction.{enter}
But...Deus is not
following its programming
of exterminating all of
civilization...{enter}
The -Seraphs-, which are
terminal interface weapons
of Deus, are using their
bodies composed of...{enter}
...nanomachines to absorb
massive numbers of people
regardless of whether
they are dead or alive.{enter}
It is not discriminating
between the mutant and 
non-mutant people. This
is highly peculiar...{enter}
...The fact that the
people who are meant to
be destroyed are being
taken in as well...{enter}
That is the absolute
opposite of what it is
supposed to be doing."

#### 15 ####
Fei
"Maybe there aren't
enough parts?"

#### 16 ####
Citan
"That is unlikely.{enter}
Aside from those bodies
that were destined to be
parts for it...{enter}
...Deus, who has already
acquired the abilities of
the nanomachines, can just
about use any material...{enter}
...to construct its body.
It is obvious, it has other
intentions in mind."

#### 17 ####
Citan
"Those intentions{wait:05}...{wait:0A}
Krelian has called Deus
the mother.{enter}
If god is the mother, then
those motives are coming
from the Great Mother{wait:05}...{enter}
Impeding the growth of its
child, {wait:0A}enveloping it,{wait:0A} to
bring the child back to the
womb to become one with it.{enter}
That is its motive. Such a
program does not exist
within its design though.{enter}
It was probably given this
unique will by someone.
Either from Elly who has
merged with the Deus or{wait:0A}..."

#### 18 ####
Fei
"Either way, it doesn't
change the fact that we
have to fight.{enter}
Regardless of what their
intentions are.
The problem is how we're
supposed to deal with them.{enter}
You think we can do it
in our current state?"

#### 19 ####
Zephyr
"This secret battleship,
Excalibur, will also take
part in the final battle.{enter}
Additionally, the military
potential of all the
surface forces will
assemble here."

#### 20 ####
Bart
"Even if we can put
together a massive force...{enter}
...we still have the
problem with the main
armament of the Merkava.{enter}
We need to know how to take
that out. As long as we
don't do that..."

#### 21 ####
Citan
"Merkava's ultra-long-range
cannon has the ability to
vaporize any substance.{enter}
On top of that, they have a
barrier around their
perimeter that nullifies
all attacks."

#### 22 ####
Zephyr
"We've fought against the
Merkava many times to try
to stop its onslaught.{enter}
However, we cannot even
get close. Hence we have
had to withdraw everytime."

#### 23 ####
Fei
"Dammit!
No matter how much we
want to save Elly...{enter}
...if we can't get
inside the Merkava,
it's meaningless."

#### 24 ####
Sigurd
"To add to that, there
is the problem of those
-Seraphs-.{enter}
...They function as the
terminal interfaces weapons
for close defense.{enter}
I can easily say that their
attack power is equivalent
to the Omnigear class."

#### 25 ####
Bart
"They even have the
regenerative ability due
to the nanomachines."

#### 26 ####
Taura
"Don't be concerned
about that."

#### 27 ####
Taura
"I was able to obtain some
data from Xenogears...{enter}
You see, Xenogears has
mutagenically evolved due
to its contact with Zohar.{enter}
Using that data, all of
your new Gears ought to
be completed soon.{enter}
Additionally, all the other
weapons and armaments are
being modified to implement
the 'Disassembler-Device'."

#### 28 ####
Billy
"Disassembler-Device?"

#### 29 ####
Taura
"In contrast to the Nano-
assemblers, which create
matter to repair with...{enter}
...the Disassembers have
the ability to dismantle
or destroy matter.{enter}
They can even deactivate
the nanomachines' restoring
ability by disengaging
their repair programs.{enter}
This should be sufficiently
effective even against the
Deus' -Seraphs-."

#### 30 ####
Fei
"Alright, even if we can
deal with the angels...{enter}
...just how are we gonna
deal with that Merkava?
We can't even get close
to the thing..."

#### 31 ####
Citan
"There is no such thing
as a perfect defense.
There is a way."

#### 32 ####
Citan
"Look over here."

#### 33 ####
Merkava's main gun requires
a 1.2 second interval to
reload because of its
tremendous output.{enter}
Upon firing, although it
is only sectional, there
will be a portion of the
barrier that will be opened.{enter}
There is a 1.87 second
delay before the barrier
reforms in that area. If
we can use this window of
time to target and destroy
that cannon, it will be
possible to close in on it.{enter}
If we can get close enough,
we can break through with
gravitational-spatial
correction.

#### 34 ####
Citan
"Well, this is the
rough idea."

#### 35 ####
Sigurd
"Unfortunately we don't
have such a long range
cannon...{enter}
...that could acquire
a target in such
a brief time frame."

#### 36 ####
Bart
"So what you're sayin' is
we just need to shut that
annoying cannon up, right?"

#### 37 ####
Fei
"...You want to
go head on into
Merkava!?"

#### 38 ####
Billy
"Now you're being reckless
again...{wait:0A} That's suicide."

#### 39 ####
Bart
"No, listen. We're not
going to just rush in.{enter}
The Yggdrasil IV and
this Excalibur are also
equipped with barriers.
That's what we'll use.{enter}
Although only for a short
time, we can withstand a
direct hit from Merkava's
main cannon.{enter}
Then we can close in and
watch for that part of the
barrier to go down and
then destroy the cannon."

#### 40 ####
Fei
"How long will our
barrier last?"

#### 41 ####
Bart
"About 20 or so seconds."

#### 42 ####
Fei
"That's all? It wouldn't
matter how fast we fly.{enter}
In that amount of time,
we'll be without a barrier
before we can get within
firing range.{enter}
And those numbers are valid
only if the generator is at
full drive, right?{enter}
You can only get those
numbers if we sacrifice
all other output and
propulsion."

#### 43 ####
Bart
"I'm not suggesting we go
in with guns blazing
knowing we're gonna lose.{enter}
We're going to physically
put a lid on it,
directly!!"

#### 44 ####
 ? 

#### 45 ####
Bart
"As you've said...{enter}
The Yggdrasil IV or
Excaliber's barrier can't
sufficiently defend against
Merkava's attack.{enter}
At least with one
generator that is..."

#### 46 ####
Billy
"Meaning...?"

#### 47 ####
Bart
"Meaning, we can defend
against the Merkava with
twice the amount of time...{enter}
...40 seconds, if we couple
the 2 generators together.
This way, we can make it
into the heart of Merkava."

#### 48 ####
Maison
"Then, what about the
propulsion..."

#### 49 ####
Bart
"Just hear me out."

#### 50 ####
This is what we do...
First we transform my Yggdrasil
into heavy assault mode and
load it onto the Excalibur so
we can couple the generators.

#### 51 ####
By doing that, we can
reduce the energy usage
down to just supporting
the hull of the ship and
generating the barrier.{enter}
This will allow most of
the energy to be devoted
to generating the barrier.{enter}
Next, shift the barrier to
full front and focus it to
a single point where their
main cannon will make its
strike.

#### 52 ####
Now for movement.
First off, we develop
a barrier by engaging
Excalibur's generator
to maximum power.{enter}
For propulsion during that
time, we'll install on the
Yggdrasil those large solid
rockets we got from the
ruins of the Mass-driver.

#### 53 ####
When Excalibur's barrier
expires, we'll use the
Yggdrasil IV's generator
to develop a barrier.{enter}
Then we'll also detach
the solid rockets and
shift the Excalibur into
conventional flight.

#### 54 ####
Using this method, we can
get right in Merkava's
face. After it fires,
it'll be defenseless.{enter}
During this time, we'll
block the muzzle of
Merkava's cannon with
Excalibur's bow ram.{enter}
Upon which, we should
have 0.67 seconds...

#### 55 ####
With the cannon fire of the
Excalibur, we'll destroy the
Yggdrasil IV's slave
generator and incapacitate
the Merkava along the way,
and then...we breakthrough!

#### 56 ####
Bart
"...That's what the plan
is all about.{enter}
The combination of the
barriers of both ships...
Storming the Merkava...{enter}
The timing of the cannon
fire of the Excalibur...
These are all going to
be crucial.{enter}
Mess up any one of these
and the consequences are
going to be severe.{enter}
Hence, it'll be necessary
to have both crews in
synch with each other.{enter}
That's why I'd like to
place Sig in command of
the Excalibur."

#### 57 ####
Sigurd
"I have no qualms
with that..."

#### 58 ####
Bart
"What do you think, Queen?
Will you lend us your
battleship?"

#### 59 ####
Zephyr
"Since there appears to
be no other alternative,
let us go with that.{enter}
Please use it as you
see fit."

#### 60 ####
Citan
"But are we not cutting it
uncomfortably close...?{enter}
...When you calculate the
arrival time and the
barrier generation time,
you will see what I mean!{enter}
One minor mishap will put
us in a situation where we
could run out of barrier
power before our arrival."

#### 61 ####
Sigurd
"Also, we will be devoting
both generators to keeping
the barriers up...{enter}
Won't that leave us
without perimeter
defenses?{enter}
We won't stand a chance
if we get engaged by the
-Seraph- angels on our
way to Merkava."

#### 62 ####
Fei
"We'll hold them off.
You can count on us!{enter}
You guys just concentrate
on taking out that main
cannon."

#### 63 ####
Bart
"Thanks.{wait:0A}
We're depending on you."

#### 64 ####
Fei
"Already, everywhere
else has been taken out.{enter}
This is the only place
that's left. This is
going to be the true
'final battle'."

#### 65 ####
