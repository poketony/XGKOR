"Battle Points are what you
earn each time you win a
battle.{wait:0F} 
There are two types of
records kept.{enter}
First, 
'Current BP'{wait:1E}
This represents the current 
number of Battle Points you 
have obtained.{enter}
You are able to exchange
'Current BP' for prizes
such as items. {wait:1E}
When you make an exchange,
the appropriate number of
points will be deducted.{enter}
Second,
'Total BP'{wait:1E}
This represents the total
amount of battle points you
have collected up to now.{enter}
'Total BP' aren't normally
affected when you exchange
items.{wait:1E} Also when your 'Total
BP' reach set values you can
exchange them for a variety
of 'Rare Items'.{enter}
But remember: caveat emptor!
Not everything is so simple!
There are also prizes that
reduce your "Total BP" too!
So pay attention when making 
exchanges!{enter}
In those cases, it might be
better to choose prizes that
don't reduce your Total BP.

you can exchange the Battle

naturally those points will
be deducted!"

rare items. When your total

"Okeydokey!{wait:0F}
Well then,{wait:05} I'll now explain
a bit about 'Battling'."

#### 254 ####
Informationist
"Battling is the sport of
fighting one-on-one with
Gears and is held at the 
Imperial Capital's arena.{enter}
The format of the sport is
simple - fight until one or
the other breaks down.{wait:0A} 
In other words, just bash
your rival to pieces!{enter}
But you don't have to fight
till you trash your Gear.{wait:05}
You are allowed to give up
during a match...so if you
can't win{wait:0A}...{wait:05}well, you know!{enter}
Finally, the armor values
of Gears during the battling
bouts are made uniform, so
that competitors can fight
on equal terms.{enter}
In other words, competitors
must rely fully on the
fundamental properties
of the Gears they pilot."

rundown{wait:05}...I think.{wait:1E}

"The next thing to do is to
gain experience by actually
Battling. {wait:0F}The key is to

But{wait:05} perhaps jumping straight
into an actual battle is too
much for you?{wait:0F} Well then,{wait:05} why
not try our 'practice mode'
for help with the controls?{enter}
This is a simulation mode
where you can practice the
basic control methods.{wait:0F}
We recommend that beginners
should train here first!{enter}

controls through to an

direction to your opponent.

Well done on a close win!"

"Too bad, you lose! It was
not due to any obvious flaw,
so you might win next time.

#### 372 ####
Receptionist
"I'll give you some advice!{wait:0F}
You're not limited to just
the ¡Á and ¡õ button's
physical attacks!{enter}
There is another attack form
called 'Ether Bullets' that
are useful on distant foes.{wait:0F}
They are simple to use,{wait:05} just
press the 'R1 button',{wait:05} OK!"

#### 373 ####
Receptionist
"Right, just remember to
press the 'R1 button' to
shoot 'Ether Bullets'!{enter}

sure!{wait:1E} (...or so we hope!?)"

#### 374 ####
Receptionist
"Attacking while jumping
is awesome! Master it!"

#### 375 ####
Receptionist
"One weakness that I can see
from watching your bout is 
that you seem to use your 
'Ether Bullets' too much.{enter}
You should better understand
the nature of the attack...
'Ether Bullets' raise your
'Heat Gauge (H.G.)' by quite
a large percentage.{enter}
Three shots will easily send
your H.G. to the MAX 
condition. If you continue 
to attack in that condition,
your machine overheats.{enter}
The excess heat begins to
cause damage, so if you
don't take care, your HP
will fall to zero before
you realize it!"

#### 376 ####
Receptionist
"The heat accumulated by
your Gear is shown in the
on-screen H.G..{enter}

this H.G.. Oh, and don't
forget to stay cool now!"

#### 377 ####
Receptionist
"The main cause of your loss
is this: your over-reliance
on 'Dash' movement! Simply
put, you run round too much!{enter}
Dashing about may be a good
strategy but you'll notice
that the 'Heat Gauge (H.G.)'
which shows your Gear's heat
level, climbs much faster!{enter}
You can continue to DASH
even after your H.G. reaches
the MAX condition, but as 
your Gear overheats more and
more, it will cause damage!

"The heat accumulated by
your Gear is shown in the

Receptionist
"Want to know why you lost?"{wait:0F}
{fast:FF}    No, I don't!
    Of course I do!

#### 381 ####
Receptionist
"There are two reasons for
your loss. First, your over-
reliance on the 'R1 button'
to shoot 'Ether bullets'.{enter}
'Ether Bullets' are useful
when your foe is far away,
but using them too much will
cause problems with your own
Gear's heat level!{enter}
Second is your over-use of
'Dash movement'. The use of
either of these when your
'Heat Gauge' is at MAX will
cause your Gear to overheat!{enter}
Whilever your overheating,
you will be taking damage,
so if you're not careful,
before you know it, your 
H.P. will fall to zero!"

#### 382 ####
Receptionist
"The point is the over-use
of either ability is bad 
for your Gear!{enter}
The heat accumulated by
your Gear is shown in the
on-screen 'Heat Gauge'.{enter}

(H.G.) to help you manage
your heat during battle.

your defeat will help you to

"Obviously the Gears were
unevenly matched...!
Or was it the pilots?{enter}
Sorry to say this to you, 
but either-way, your not 
much of an opponent!"

#### 385 ####
Receptionist
"Practice makes perfect! 
We recommend our 'Practice 
Mode' to you. Try it today!"

#### 386 ####
Receptionist
"So near yet so far! 
Too bad!
You almost had him!"

#### 387 ####

"That was a good match! 
Either of you could have 
easily won! Now try harder 
to win on the rebound!"

Receptionist
"{wait:05}...{wait:05}Are you a pacifist?
{wait:05}...{wait:05}Or don't you know how to 
control a Gear?{enter}
You need to know the basic
controls, so perhaps you 
should try out our Practice 
Mode! Speak to the girl at 
the counter next to me."

#### 389 ####
Receptionist
"You can't just do nothing
and expect to win!
You need to practice first 
to get the hang of it!"
