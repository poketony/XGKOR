Have you met Queen Zephyr
yet?{enter}
She still can't forget
about the tragedy in Nisan
during the great war, 500
years ago.{wait:14} Even though
it's not her fault...{enter}

members though she had no
knowledge of what was

know anything.{wait:14} Anyhow,
keep up the good work in
overthrowing Solaris,
young man!

Keep it up the good work
in overthrowing Solaris.{wait:14}
I'm counting on you.
