#### 1 ####
Bart
"I guess that's it."

#### 2 ####
Bart
"Oh yeah? {wait:1E}
So looks like we've got a
real fanatic here, huh!"

#### 3 ####
Bart
"What's an old man like
you doing in a place 
like this?"

#### 4 ####
Bart
"A collector, huh?
Sounds interesting."

#### 5 ####
Bart
"The things on this shelf,
are they some of the stuff
you have found?"

#### 6 ####
Ol' man Bal
"You mean the fossils?
They're one of the 
things I collect.{enter}
Feel free to have a
look at them."

#### 7 ####
Ol' man Bal
"Around here you can dig up
ancient machines along with
human and animal fossils. {enter}
Notice anything particular
on these shelves? They go
from oldest on the left,
to newest on the right."

#### 8 ####
Bart
"Are you an archaeologist
or something, old man?{enter}
I don't quite see what
you're talking about.{enter}
They just look like a
bunch of old bones to me.
Fei, what do you think?"

#### 9 ####
Fei
"...Let me see.{wait:1E}
First, there are no
human bones up to here.{enter}
Then, from here on over
to the right, something
is slightly different...
I guess."

#### 10 ####
Ol' man Bal
"Yes, from a certain point
in time, human fossils
suddenly no longer appear.{enter}
That point is roughly
10,000 years ago."

#### 11 ####
Bart
"What does that mean?"

#### 12 ####
Ol' man Bal
"Don't ask me.
I don't know for sure...{enter}
But my guess is, there
were no humans on this
planet before then.{wait:1E}
At least it appears so."

#### 13 ####
Bart
"How could that be?
What about all that
talk about evolution?"

#### 14 ####
Ol' man Bal
"You mean the theory of
evolution as taught by
the 'Ethos', right?{enter}
You can't trust that!
Rather, I believe in the
old legends and myths."

#### 15 ####
Fei
"Legends?
Myths?"

#### 16 ####
Ol' man Bal
"Haven't you heard
of this story...?"

#### 17 ####
Ol' man Bal
"They say that humans and
god lived together in a
paradise in the sky.{enter}
With god's protection,
there was no fear of death
and natural disasters were
entirely unknown.{enter}
Then one day, the humans
ate a forbidden fruit
which gave them incredible
wisdom.{enter}
But god drove mankind from
the paradise for their sin.{enter}
Bitter at having been
driven out of paradise,
humans used the wisdom they
had gained to make giants.{enter}
With these giants, they
planned to challenge god
himself. But god poured
his wrath down on them.{enter}
All who defied god were
destroyed. 
But god himself did not
escape unharmed.{enter}
Taking paradise with him,
the wounded god buried
himself deep beneath the
ocean to sleep for eons.{enter}
Before going to sleep, god
used his remaining power to
create right-hearted humans
to live on this planet.{enter}
These people are said to
be...{wait:1E}our ancestors."

#### 18 ####
Ol' man Bal
"Well, anyway, I'll
stop my rambling now."

#### 19 ####
Fei
"By the way, does 
this cave have..."

#### 20 ####
Ol' man Bal
"An exit?{enter}
There is an exit in the
excavation site beyond the
sand barrier. You can get
outside through there."

#### 21 ####
Bart
"Sand barrier? You mean
that huge wall you can
see from your entrance?"

#### 22 ####
Ol' man Bal
"Yes, that's it.
On the other side is an
old Aveh excavation site.{enter}
They built the wall when
Aveh was excavating here
to keep the sand from
falling in from above.{enter}
But they've stopped work
there now."

#### 23 ####
Fei
"So, how do we open such
a huge thing like that?"

#### 24 ####
Bart
"If it's a wall,
you can probably
break it down."

#### 25 ####
Ol' man Bal
"Hold your horses
there young'uns.{enter}
No matter how good a Gear
you have, you'll never
break that wall down.{enter}
It's much too strong.{wait:1E}
So...
let's make a deal." 

#### 26 ####
Bart
"A deal?"

#### 27 ####
Ol' man Bal
"The wall was closed
due to the reaction of
the 'Sand Sensors'.{enter}
Thanks to that, now I
can't get through to
the other side either.{enter}
Maybe it happened when
you two fell in here.
Were you boys fighting
up there or something?"

#### 28 ####
Fei
"You seem to be able
to tell everything!{enter}
Anyway, so what can
we do about it?"

#### 29 ####
Ol' man Bal
"It's very simple.
You just have to turn off
the Sand Sensor switches.{enter}
Doing that will keep the
barrier from closing again.{wait:1E}
While you two are doing
that, I'll open it up."

#### 30 ####
Fei
"Right, got it."

#### 31 ####
Ol' man Bal
"The sensors are in two
places. You should see
their flashing red lights.{enter}
Well, good luck then." 

#### 32 ####
Fei
"Let's go Bart."

#### 33 ####
Ol' man Bal
"Oh, before you go...{enter}
I can share some parts
and fuel with you.{wait:14}
Just talk to me whenever
you need something, right."

#### 34 ####
Bart
"Thanks, old man.{wait:14}
Well, we'll go and finish
our part of the deal then!"

#### 35 ####
Fei
"Well done, old man!"

#### 36 ####
Ol' man Bal
"Our deal is done."

#### 37 ####
Bart
"Hey, old man.
There's one thing I
want to ask you."

#### 38 ####
Ol' man Bal
"What is it?"

#### 39 ####
Bart
"I've heard somewhere on
this planet is a Gear far
superior to all others.{enter}
I've heard that it was
called 'the god Gear' and
was made in ancient times
but hidden away somewhere.{enter}
Do you know anything
about it?"

#### 40 ####
Ol' man Bal
"A man-made god, created
with the wisdom of god!{enter}
Such a Gear would have the
power of a thousand Gears.
In a wave of its arm, it
could destroy whole cities.{enter}
Its battle cries would
thunder in the heavens.{enter}
You must be speaking of
the 'Omnigear'."

#### 41 ####
Bart
"You know of it? {enter}
Then perhaps it was what
you were speaking about in
that tale you told us of
the battle with god..."

#### 42 ####
Ol' man Bal
"Goodness gracious,
you too, boy?{enter}
Those stories were made
to inspire man's soul.
But they're just legends.
They don't really exist."

#### 43 ####
Ol' man Bal
"Anyway, allow me take
a look at your Gears.{enter}
It'll only take a
little while, so
wait here please."

#### 44 ####
Bart
"Hey, wait!{wait:1E}
Arhh, he's gone..."

#### 45 ####
Fei
"Hey Bart. Do you think the
Gear in that story's buried
in the ground somewhere?"

#### 46 ####
Bart
"I think that's
what I've heard."

#### 47 ####
Fei
"Could one of the Gears we
are using possibly be it?"

#### 48 ####
Bart
"Yeah, right!
What are the chances
of that happening?

#### 49 ####
Fei
"?"

#### 50 ####
Bart
"The Gears that are
excavated lately...{enter}
...are usually only a
few hundred years old.
Nowhere nearly as old as
the Gear in that legend."

#### 51 ####
Fei
"Then why were they
in the ground...?"

#### 52 ####
Bart
"I don't know.
There are no records.{wait:1E} 
Except..."

#### 53 ####
Fei
"Except what?"

#### 54 ####
Bart
"There must be some truth
in the tales that they were
buried after a great war...{enter}
The bullet wounds covering
most of the Gear's armor
would appear to confirm
that."

#### 55 ####
Fei
"You mean that there are
no records from the last
several hundred years?{enter}
How about before that?"

#### 56 ####
Bart
"None from either period.{enter}
The 'Ethos' controls
all the records from
that time period.{enter}
Maybe they have some very
ancient records too...{enter}
All we know about our
history is from the
little pieces that we
find for ourselves."

#### 57 ####
Bart
"Anyway Fei, what do you
make of the old man?"

#### 58 ####
Fei
"What do you mean...?"

#### 59 ####
Bart
"Why would such an old 
man live all alone in
this abandoned cave?"

#### 60 ####
Fei
"I don't know.{wait:1E} Probably
digging for ancient
Gears or something?"

#### 61 ####
Bart
"Right!
So you think so too?"

#### 62 ####
Fei
"Hey!
I just said that as a joke.{enter}
Don't take all that stuff 
seriously. They're only
legends, you know."

#### 63 ####
Bart
"No...that old man 
is up to something!"

#### 64 ####
Ol' man Bal
"This can't be..."

#### 65 ####
Fei
"??"

#### 66 ####
Bart
"What's wrong, old man?"

#### 67 ####
Ol' man Bal
"Is this your Gear?"

#### 68 ####
Fei
"Well, 
sort of..."

#### 69 ####
Ol' man Bal
"Where did you get it?"

#### 70 ####
Fei
"I'm just borrowing it."

#### 71 ####
This is...{clear:1E}

#### 72 ####
the{wait:05} host{wait:05} for{wait:05} the{wait:05} spirit{wait:05}
of{wait:05} the{wait:05} slayer{wait:05} of{wait:1E} god{wait:1E}...{clear:1E}

#### 73 ####
Fei
"Wait a moment! 
What did you just say?"

#### 74 ####
Ol' man Bal
"Nothing.
I didn't say anything!!"

#### 75 ####
Fei
"No! I heard you!
You said, slayer of god...{enter}
That's what you said,
isn't it old man!!"

#### 76 ####
Ol' man Bal
"Your Gears are fixed.
You have no more
business here.{enter}
This is a bad time for me.
Be on your way!"

#### 77 ####
Fei
"Be on our way...?
Listen here, old man...!!"

#### 78 ####
Fei
"You mean, you can tell
what's wrong just by the
sound of its footsteps?"

#### 79 ####
a

#### 80 ####
Ol' man Bal
"I told you to leave!"
    Tell us some more
    Sell us Gear parts

#### 81 ####
Ol' man Bal
"I have nothing more to say
to you, so just leave."

#### 82 ####
Ol' man Bal
"When Calamity beats you,
I'll just get these parts
back anyway...{enter}
If you don't mind that then
I'll sell them to you...!"
    For Gear
    For characters

#### 83 ####
Ol' man Bal
"First, try changing
the engine."

#### 84 ####
Ol' man Bal
"Now hurry and shut off
the Sand Sensors.{enter}
Or do you have something
else you want to ask?"{enter}
    Where are the sensors?
    About Gear functions
    Got any parts to sell?
    Nothing

#### 85 ####
Ol' man Bal
"Hmm, which do you want?"
    For Gear use
    For character use

#### 86 ####
Ol' man Bal
"You seem to have shut off
the 'Sand Sensor' on the
ledge in the Great Hall...{enter}
But there's another 'Sand
Sensor' on the road from
which you can see the
waterfalls.{enter}
It's on a rock ledge,
northwest of where my
repair robot stands.{enter}
Anything else you want?"
    Explain Gear functions
    Got any parts to sell?
    Nothing

#### 87 ####
Ol' man Bal
"Hmm, what do you want?"
    Parts for Gears
    Character items

#### 88 ####
Ol' man Bal
"You seem to have shut
off the Sand Sensor in
Waterfall Grotto. {enter}
But there's still one more,
above the big boulder in
the Great Hall. I think
you've seen it already.{enter}
Anything else?"
    Explain Gear functions
    Got any parts to sell?
    Nothing

#### 89 ####
Ol' man Bal
"Hmm, what do you want?"
    Parts for Gears
    Character items

#### 90 ####
Ol' man Bal
"Oh, good timing.
I was just about to open
up the sand barrier now."

#### 91 ####
"It's been a while since
I last serviced a Gear.
This should be fun."

#### 92 ####
Ol' man Bal
"A Gear's strength changes
with the parts equipped and
how the pilot handles it.{enter}
First, let's talk about
the Engine.{enter}
With a good Engine your
Attack Power and fuel 
capacity go up.{enter}
HP depends on the Frame
and Defense Ability on
the Armor equipped.{enter}
Here's a tip for when your
fuel is low: use 'Charge'
to replenish it a little
as you defend yourself.{enter}
When you are fighting a
strong enemy, use 'Booster'
to increase your mobility
and power.{enter}
If you use Booster too
much though, your fuel
will run out.{enter}
So think carefully and
try to find your own
style of fighting."

#### 93 ####
Ol' man Bal
"First, changing the
engine is a good idea."

#### 94 ####
It's been a long time
since my last visitor.
What happened? Did you
fall from the surface?

#### 95 ####
I see...
That's too bad. {enter}
I can tell from the sound
that you both ride good
Gears...{enter}
But the legs seem to be
playing up a bit.

#### 96 ####
Ha ha ha.
It's easy to know what's
wrong with Gears by the
sounds they make.{enter}
My guess is that one
of them needs a new
hydromechanic pipe
in its joints.{enter}
It's making a
nasty sound.
It must be hard to
walk with too.{enter}
Oh, by the way, the
name's Balthazar,
but you can call me
Ol' man Bal.

#### 97 ####
Ol' man Bal
"I guess you can call me a
'fossicker' or a 'collector
of things'.{enter}
There is much to be found
lying around in this here
stalactite cavern."

#### 98 ####
Bart
"Hey, Fei! This is a
surprise! There's someone
living in this place!"

#### 99 ####
Hmm, it's been a while,
but I thought I could hear
the sound of Gears.
I assume they are yours?{enter}
Well anyway, come on back
in here and make yourself
at home.

#### 100 ####
Fei
"I don't know where they
are. Can you tell me?"

#### 101 ####
Ol' man Bal
"One is up on the rock
ledge above the boulder
in the 'Great Hall'.{enter}
You can find it by climbing
the 'Terrace Stones' out
there and heading into the
passage on northwest wall.{enter}
The other sensor is on
the road from which you
can see the waterfalls.{enter}
You can get to it by going
northwest from the place
where the Gear is standing.
It is on a rock ledge.{enter}
You can tell that it is a
Sand Sensor by its square
shape and the flashing red
light it emits."
