You people...{wait:1E}
You're not residents here.{enter}
I know from your aura.{wait:1E}
I too, once lived near
the Royal Capital.{enter}
I swindled people using
fake goods when I lived
there.{enter}
I came to hate doing
those things...{enter}
Then I heard of this place
from some pilgrims.{enter}
I alternate gate duty
with the guy outside but,
it's pretty interesting.{enter}
Everyday I see the
pilgrim's faces and get
impressions, like{enter}
this person is very
troubled, {wait:1E}...and such.{enter}
I used to use that
ability to get money
from people...{enter}
Now I'd never think of 
doing that.

#### 3 ####
I'm from the royal army
stationed down south.{enter}
I may work for the current
government but my heart
belongs to Nisan. I cannot
desert it.{enter}
I hear there are lots of
people like me who are
gathering here.{enter}
The residents here are
kindly renting me this
room...{enter}
Now I'm waiting here
until something starts
happening.
