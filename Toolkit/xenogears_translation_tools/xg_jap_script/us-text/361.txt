"Uh...it doesn't move.{wait:14}
Is it broken...?{enter}
...?{wait:14}
There's something small
written here...{enter}
'The one who attains the
dawn, the dusk, and the
darkness shall climb the
path to heaven...{wait:14}Wiseman'{enter}
What is this?"

#### 2 ####
Fei
"Alright, then...
Set those three stones we
found into here..."

#### 3 ####
The stepping stone has
been brought back to life.

#### 4 ####
Oh, we rarely have
visitors from the surface.{enter}
Welcome to the wandering 
city in the sky, Aphel 
Aura.

#### 5 ####
This city used to be the
capital of Shevat, an
independent liberal country 
that fought against Solaris.{enter}
A place that turns
yesterday's tears into
tomorrow's smiles...{wait:14}
That's what they called
this city a long time ago...{enter}
But now, those hopes and
despairs have been worn
away long ago...{enter}
Probably the only things
that remain are the echoes
of resentment...

#### 6 ####
You might be able to find
something that can solve
your troubles and sadness.{enter}
But fate can be cruel
sometimes...{wait:14}
Don't forget that.

#### 7 ####
And, that stone plate
floating there is called
a Stepping Stone.{wait:14} It
moves with people on it.{enter}
Try and get on it and
talk to the stone.{wait:14}
It'll be glad to give
three of you a ride.

#### 8 ####
{fast:FF}Do you want to go up?{wait:0A}
    Yes
    No

#### 9 ####
{fast:FF}Do you want to go down?{wait:0A}
    Yes
    No

#### 10 ####
{fast:FF}Do you want to go down?{wait:0A}
    Yes
    No

#### 11 ####
{fast:FF}Do you want to go up?{wait:14}
    Yes
    No

#### 12 ####
Oh, are you new?{wait:14}
It's been so long since
last time we had a visitor
from the surface.{enter}
This is a 'Plant Shell'.{wait:14}
Vegetables and fruits
needed in Shevat are grown 
in it.

#### 13 ####
Since we live away from
the land, we must put
more effort to get food.{enter}
Right now, it's a dusty
season so only the staff
members are allowed to 
go in.{enter}
Humans are good carriers 
of germs, you know.

#### 14 ####
I'll bring some fresh
Thunder Strawberries for
you to eat.{wait:14} So look
forward to it.

#### 15 ####
{fast:FF}Hello, what can I do for
you?{wait:14}
    I want thread!
    Hear a story

#### 16 ####
{fast:FF}After all, pain only
causes more pain and
sadness...{enter}
How come those guys up
there don't understand
such a simple thing...?{enter}
Just relax, have fun
fishing like that sage
who disappeared.

#### 17 ####
{fast:FF}Do you like fishing?{wait:14}
    Yes
    Not really...

#### 18 ####
{fast:FF}I see. Then, do you want
to try catching some fish
in the plaza?{wait:14} Fishing is
prohibited there though.

#### 19 ####
{fast:FF}I see...{wait:14}
The sage loved fishing.
He used to go to the plaza
and catch Leviathans.{enter}
After catching the fish,
he'd feed it some small
black stone and let it
go... {enter}
I wonder if that was 
just fish food.

#### 20 ####
{fast:FF}I have some good thread.
Want it for 50G?{wait:14}
    I'll buy it!!
    No thanks...

#### 21 ####
{fast:FF}Hey, you already have some
good spider thread.{enter}
Try hanging the line in
the center of the plaza.{wait:14}
You'll catch a fish if
you're good.

#### 22 ####
{fast:FF}Here you go.
Thanks.{enter}
Try hanging the line in
the center of the plaza.{wait:14}
You'll catch a fish if
you're good.

#### 23 ####
Received Spider Web!

#### 24 ####
{fast:FF}You have no money?{wait:14}
Come back when you do.

#### 25 ####
{fast:FF}Are you sure?
It's good thread...

#### 26 ####
This city has been
wandering the sky like
this for 500 years...{enter}
Just watching the 
everchanging countries, 
the world, and those who
appeared and disappeared...{enter}
The people in Shevat lost
power, so that's all they
could do...{enter}
Being able to observe may
have been a reward for
those people here.

#### 27 ####
The people in this city
had dreamed of going
down to the land again
for a long time...{enter}
They dreamed of the day
when they could go down
to the free world after
fleeing from Solaris...{enter}
I have a hunch the day
may not be {wait:14}too far away.

#### 28 ####
Why do humans hate and
hurt each other?{wait:14}
Everyone lives under
the same blue sky...{enter}
Will there ever be any
relief from the pain of
losing what was precious
to us?{enter}
When will it be the day 
we can understand what
all this loneliness and
sorrow was for?{enter}
In short, we may be
repeating the same 
mistake we made
500 years ago...

#### 29 ####
This is the end of the
city.{wait:14} If you're not
leaving yet, you better
turn back.

#### 30 ####
Oh, so you're waiting
to meet up with Maria?{wait:0A}
    Yes, that's right!
    No, we're not.

#### 31 ####
If that's the case then...
under there is a house that
no one lives in anymore.

#### 32 ####
Maria often used to go there
and sit all alone in the
second floor of that house
and think about things.{enter}
Why don't you check out the
place and see what you can
find while you wait for her
there...

#### 33 ####
Oh? So you're not?{wait:0A} Sorry.{wait:14}
Well anyway, why not rest
up and unwind in our fair
city...
