I'm a celebrated Gear
weapons specialist...{wait:14}
But lately there's been
no interesting work...{enter}
There are no men with
enough guts to ask me
to forge them a weapon
to fight Deus...{enter}
If you bring me a nifty
sword, I can forge it into
something truly amazing
for you, anytime...{enter}
But I won't work for
anyone rude enough
to ask me to check a
weapon while it's still
equipped to their Gear!

This came out great!{wait:14}

Use this sword and
make Deus and his
legions pay!
