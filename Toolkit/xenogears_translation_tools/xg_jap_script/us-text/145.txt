Shakhan
"There is a customary
Tournament after the
dedication ceremony..."

#### 2 ####
Ramsus
"What about the incident
in that report?"

#### 3 ####
Shakhan
"What? Oh, you mean the
500-year-old mobile weapon
excavated from the ruins?{enter}
Thanks to the help of the
'Ethos', the repairs are
complete.{enter}
I thought we could announce
it on the day of the
dedication ceremony..."

#### 4 ####
Ramsus
"Toys like that should
be given to Vanderkaum.{enter}
I'm talking about the
'Fatima Jasper'."

#### 5 ####
Shakhan
"I already have obtained
one half of the crest.{enter}
But I haven't been able
to get her to tell me
where the other half is.{enter}
She is a rather strong-
willed girl..."

#### 6 ####
Ramsus
"You're not being rough
with her, are you?"

#### 7 ####
Shakhan
"Of course not. I know
how you despise vulgar
acts like that."

#### 8 ####
Ramsus
"You said that girl is the
Holy Mother of Nisan...{wait:32}
Is she upstairs?"

#### 9 ####
Shakhan
"Yes, in the
east tower."

#### 10 ####
Ramsus
"Miang, could
it possibly be
a 'Relic'?"

#### 11 ####
Miang
"Yes. But there is still no
response. There seems to be
a barrier or something.{enter}
However, we do know from
the 500-year-old records
that one certainly exists
in this vicinity.{enter}
It's probably well
preserved too."

#### 12 ####
Ramsus
"...Let's meet her.{enter}
I want to talk to her
directly. Miang, you
come with me."

#### 13 ####
Miang
"Yes sir."

#### 14 ####
Grahf
"I believe I already
said your tricks will
do you no good."

#### 15 ####
Miang
"I'm just trying to help.
Didn't I help get those
'shackles' off?{enter}
Now, you know the 'vessel'
will only respond to the
chosen one.{enter}
They don't know this.
But...he's necessary for
Kahr.{enter}
He's the very meaning of
Kahr's existence."

#### 16 ####
Miang
"Yes, I must thank you.
After all, you did help
me didn't you?"

#### 17 ####
Grahf
"..."

#### 18 ####
Miang
"Was it for me?
Or for him?
...Or...for yourself?"

#### 19 ####
Margie
"No! I don't want to go
back up there"

#### 20 ####
No response.
