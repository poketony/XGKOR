{name:07:チュチュ}
"Chu bad!
We were so close...!"

Maria
"We were so close...!"

We came to an enormous
cavern that was big
enough to swallow the
whole capital of Aveh.

#### 8 ####
In its center were two
gently glowing objects.

#### 9 ####
It was the source
of divine wisdom{wait:05}...{wait:05}
It was {wait:0A}'Razael's Tree'.

#### 10 ####
And the cavern itself
was a giant computer
called Razael.

#### 11 ####
The wisdom of god,{wait:05}
hidden within Razael{wait:05}...{wait:05}
We found the unthinkable
when we accessed its data.

#### 12 ####
A large unmanned strategic
weapon and its battalion of
terminal interface weapons,
travelling from star system
to star system.{wait:05}
And a gargantuan mothership
used to carry them{wait:05}...

#### 13 ####
The creation of the
-Malakh- angel{wait:05}...{wait:05}
God's army to reign over
the vast universe with{wait:05}...{wait:05}
 {wait:14}
And the construction of a
divine ark{wait:05}...

#### 14 ####
These weapons were called,{wait:3C}
'Yabeh', {wait:05}the inter-planetary
invasion weapon system.

#### 15 ####
What the Gazel Ministry was
pursuing was right here.

#### 16 ####
According to the data, the
giant, rotting organism we
just defeated was in fact
the nucleus of this system.

#### 17 ####
We were on the verge of
accessing the data for
the object called...
 
        'Zohar'       {enter}
...the central neural circuit
and power source controlling
the entire system, from the
weapons to the mothership...

#### 18 ####
When suddenly,
'HE' appeared.

#### 19 ####
Krelian
"Ah, the hidden data
from Razael's Tree...
Move away from there.{enter}
This matter is far
too weighty for the
likes of you."

#### 20 ####
Fei
"We must protect it with
our lives! We can't let
them have the Razael data!"

#### 21 ####
Citan
"You handle them!
I will try and extract as
much data as I am able to!{enter}
If anything goes wrong...
I will destroy this place!"
