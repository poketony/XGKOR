Since that disaster happened
to the 'Ethos', they've been
running around like fools...{enter}
Now, just getting parts is a
tough enough task.

#### 2 ####
If requests for repairs
keep coming at this pace,
we won't be able to keep up.{enter}
We should ask the 'Ethos'
headquarters to expand this
workshop.

#### 3 ####
I'm selling the parts
in the warehouse now,
but if this keeps up,
they're gonna run out.

#### 4 ####
We're out of Gear parts
in the warehouse.
I'm gonna have to order
more from the 'Ethos'
headquarters.

#### 5 ####
I have finished restocking
the parts, now maybe I can
get some rest at last.

#### 6 ####
I'm gonna have to
cooperate with the
surviving mechanics.

#### 7 ####
I'll have to ask the
'Ethos' headquarters
to send a mechanic that
can repair army Gears.

#### 8 ####
The competition is 
all gone.{wait:0F} Sigh.

#### 9 ####
The rest of the country 
has an unusual interest 
in this area's ruins.{enter}
Large units have come to 
excavate all the ruins.

#### 10 ####
Hey, I haven't seen you
'round here before.{enter}
Don't think that if you
cause trouble you'll get
away with it!{enter}
We're Aveh Army Guards!
...Remember that!

   -This month's goal-   
 
    Search for parts!

#### 12 ####
   -This month's goal-
 
   Don't let the parts
 in the warehouse run out.
 
   Give repair priority
  to military personnel.
