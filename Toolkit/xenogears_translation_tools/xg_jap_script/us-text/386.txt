#### 1 ####
Your Majesty,
something dreadful
has...!!

#### 2 ####
Fei
"Your Majesty...{wait:14}
You...
The child...?"

#### 3 ####
Fei
"522...!?{wait:14}
Is that really
possible...?"

#### 4 ####
Fei
"I see...
You're quite right.{enter}
But, there's no guarantee
that you aren't the same
as Solaris, right?{enter}
Even if Solaris were to be
defeated, the people of the
surface may just as well
encounter a new dominator."

#### 5 ####
Fei
"..."

#### 6 ####
Fei
"Huh...!?"{clear:14}

#### 7 ####
Fei
"What was that shaking
all about...!?"

#### 8 ####
Fei
"What!?"

#### 9 ####
Fei
"Then should we go down
with Maria?{enter}
It's the Gebler, right?{wait:14}
I'm still ticked off at
them. I'll take'em on."

#### 10 ####
Fei
"Then, let's get
going, Maria."

#### 11 ####
Fei
"Alright, I got it.{wait:14}
Then one of us should
stay behind."

#### 12 ####
Fei
"Yeah...
I know, doc.{wait:14}
We'll go!{enter}
We're already involved.{wait:14}
And, we can't just stand
by and watch these
people die."

#### 13 ####
Fei
"...?{wait:14}
Going chu help...?{enter}
{name:07:チュチュ}, what're
you doing here?"

#### 14 ####
Fei
"What am I gonna do...{wait:14}
This isn't a game.{enter}
It's dangerous, so go back
to the Yggdrasil.{wait:14} Okay,
{name:07:チュチュ}? Be a good girl."

#### 15 ####
Fei
"Tch, alright...{wait:14} Don't come
crying to me when things
get outta hand."

#### 16 ####
Fei
"I'll go too.{wait:14} I'm a little
concerned if it's Elly."

#### 17 ####
Elly
"Your Majesty...{wait:14}
Y, you...?
You're the...?"

#### 18 ####
Elly
"...{wait:14}
Yes...
I understand."

#### 19 ####
Bart
"Thank you for coming...?{wait:14}
What is this?
It's just a kid."

#### 20 ####
Bart
"Tch.
Something's not right.{enter}
This fight for independence
from a tyrant. The battle
for freedom.{enter}
I see, you make it seem
like your intentions are
noble.{enter}
In reality though, maybe
you're no different than
Solaris?{enter}
Anyway, I'm too busy with
trying to take Aveh back
from that bastard, Shakhan.{enter}
Hate to break this to you,
but I don't have the time!"

#### 21 ####
Bart
"Uh..."

#### 22 ####
Rico
"Hmph... Alright. Your
story sounds quite noble.{enter}
But, what is there to stop
Shevat from taking up a
dictatorship after Solaris
falls?{enter}
Those taking down the seat
of power usually become...{enter}
...infatuated with their
own power and make its
people suffer.

#### 23 ####
Rico
"Hmm...{wait:14}
I see, now.{enter}
So you want to take down
our common enemy first."

#### 24 ####
Billy
"Your Majesty...{wait:14}
Y, you...?"

#### 25 ####
{name:07:チュチュ}
"Alright! {name:07:チュチュ}'s
going chu help too!"

#### 26 ####
{name:07:チュチュ}
"Uh hmm... {name:07:チュチュ}'s not
a good girl.{wait:14} I'm in that
dangerous age right now."

#### 27 ####
{name:07:チュチュ}
"And {name:07:チュチュ}
can help chu!{enter}
I'm going with
all of you.{wait:14}
Yeah? Yeah?"

#### 28 ####
{name:07:チュチュ}
"R, really?{wait:14}
They're all here?{enter}
Yaaay! I finally found
them!! {name:07:チュチュ}'s friends.
They're here!!"

#### 29 ####
{name:07:チュチュ}
"Now, let's put
everything into it.{enter}
Everyone, we have chu
give it our best shot!"

#### 30 ####
Maria
"Heh, so they call you
{name:07:チュチュ} also.{enter}
Many of your friends live
in this city.{wait:14} You want to
go meet them later?"

#### 31 ####
Maria
"Your Majesty, I will go
with {name:13:ゼプツェン}!"

#### 32 ####
Maria
"Fine...{wait:14}
I understand."

#### 33 ####
Maria
"Yes!{wait:14}
{name:13:ゼプツェン} is ready to
go any time!"

#### 34 ####
Zephyr
"Break the Gate and open
the path to Solaris.{enter}
That will lead to the land
dweller's freedom.{wait:14} Please,
Fei."

#### 35 ####
Zephyr
"Now go and get some
rest for now."

#### 36 ####
Zephyr
"As usual, be careful.{wait:14}
And take care of Maria
for us."

#### 37 ####
Zephyr
"Have you decided?"{wait:0A}
    My heart is set!
    Let me think some more

#### 38 ####
Zephyr
"Alright.{wait:14}
Allow me to hear out
your decision."

#### 39 ####
Zephyr
"Take your time and think
about it to your heart's
content.{enter}
To make sure there are no
regrets."

#### 40 ####
Zephyr
"Thank you for coming such
a long way.{wait:14} I am the Queen
of Shevat, Zephyr."

#### 41 ####
Zephyr
"I may appear to be like
this, but I am actually
522 years old."

#### 42 ####
Zephyr
"Yes...{enter}
I and a select few of the
vassals have undergone some
special life-extending
treatments.{enter}
We were required to
continue living...{wait:14} Until
that final day approaches.{wait:14}
Because of one man...{enter}
To continue living...{wait:14}
This is our atonement...
for that tragedy
500 years ago..."

#### 43 ####
Zephyr
"Let us discontinue this
discussion of the past.{enter}
I've heard many things
about all of you from
Wiseman.{enter}
Wiseman has been conducting
his operations on the
surface under my orders...{enter}
...to keep an eye on that
man's activities.{enter}
Also, he was ordered to
bring anyone from the
surface who would be of
help to us to Shevat...{enter}
500 years ago we fought
against Solaris for the
freedom of the land
dwellers.{enter}
Even after that, we
continue to resist Solaris
although we are short of
any real power."

#### 44 ####
Zephyr
"Land dwellers, can you
find it in your heart
to help us?{enter}
We must free mankind from
the grasps of Solaris...{enter}
We must gain true freedom
and build a peacful world
to live in."

#### 45 ####
Zephyr
"Hmm...You are apparently
nothing like the calm and
quiet Roni Fatima, Bart.{enter}
Yet, you are so similar to
Roni at the same time...{wait:14}
There is logic behind what
you say, though."

#### 46 ####
Zephyr
"However, I tell no lie...{enter}
...when I say we are doing
this purely for the future
of the land dwellers.{enter}
If you still cannot believe
us, then defeat Solaris,
gain back the independence
of the land dwellers...{enter}
...and then see if we still
embrace the heavens
together.{enter}
The pretexts of the past,
the discord between
nations. Why be concerned
at such a small scale?{enter}
You must look at the bigger
picture!"

#### 47 ####
Zephyr
"However, I tell no lie...{enter}
...when I say we are doing
this purely for the future
of the land dwellers.{enter}
If you still cannot believe
us, then defeat Solaris,
gain back the independence
of the land dwellers...{enter}
...and then see if we still
embrace the heavens
together."

#### 48 ####
Zephyr
"It should do you some good
if you rest in the palace
and think about it.{enter}
You must think about what
you ought to do.{enter}
But remember, Solaris has
been quite active lately.{wait:14}
So we don't have much time
for leisure."

#### 49 ####
Zephyr
"As for you, Elly...
Your family and friends...{enter}
You must understand that
they will all have to be
your enemies.{enter}
Without this clear
understanding...{enter}
...You may be placing your
companions in a situation
where it may cost them
their lives..."

#### 50 ####
Zephyr
"Very well then.{wait:14}
Now go and get some rest."

#### 51 ####
Zephyr
"What's the meaning of
this?"

#### 52 ####
Yes! That is...{wait:14} We have an
intruder in the dock area!
The Gate generator has been
destroyed...!

#### 53 ####
Zephyr
"What's the damage report?"

#### 54 ####
Y, yes! Sub-systems are
destroyed...{wait:14}
Gate generation has
dropped 70% from normal!{enter}
We're devoting everything
to fire fighting and
repairs...{wait:14} It will still
take some time!

#### 55 ####
Zephyr
"What of the intruder?"

#### 56 ####
Yes, we believe it's just
a lone Gebler soldier.{enter}
It seems the individual
has escaped to the number
17 hangar!

#### 57 ####
Zephyr
"Maria, wait!"

#### 58 ####
Zephyr
"It is too dangerous
to go by yourself."

#### 59 ####
Your Majesty, we have our
hands full just trying to
fight the fire on the
shield generator.{enter}
If someone doesn't do
something, it's possible
we'll have more losses...!

#### 60 ####
Zephyr
"Maria, what can you do
now when you don't even
have {name:13:ゼプツェン}?"

#### 61 ####
Zephyr
"...
Is it fine with you, Fei?{enter}
Please take care of Maria.{wait:14}
And be careful out there."

#### 62 ####
Who will you leave here?{wait:14}
    Leave {name:81:unknown}
    Leave {name:82:unknown}

#### 63 ####
Maria has joined the party!

#### 64 ####
Zephyr
"Fei..."

#### 65 ####
Zephyr
"Allow me to put it
on screen."

#### 66 ####
We are finally able to
locate and see Solaris
after destroying the 3
Gates on the surface.{enter}
However, unless we destroy
the final main generator on
the Solaris homeland...{enter}
...we cannot completely
wipeout their Gate.

#### 67 ####
It seems the intruder has
escaped to the hangar bay.{wait:14}
If something happens to
{name:13:ゼプツェン}...!

#### 68 ####
Umm, this may be asking for
too much, but would it be
possible to have one of you
stay behind with the Queen?

#### 69 ####
We do not have the combat
experience and...{wait:14}if
something ever happened to
the Queen...

#### 70 ####
Maria
"Was that enemy...!?"

#### 71 ####
Maria
"Number 17 hangar bay!?{wait:14}
{name:13:ゼプツェン}...!!"

#### 72 ####
Maria
"But...
We can't just let
the spy be...!"

#### 73 ####
Maria
"I'll be fine.{wait:14}
I can go it alone...!!"

#### 74 ####
Maria
"...!{wait:14}
But..."

#### 75 ####
Maria
"Then, let's all go
together."

#### 76 ####
Elly
"Shall I come along?"{wait:14}
    Change
    Don't change

#### 77 ####
Elly has joined the party!

#### 78 ####
Elly
"Yes...!
We'll do what we can to
protect the people here!"

#### 79 ####
Elly
"Well...
In all the bustle,
she somehow tagged along."

#### 80 ####
Elly
"Yes...{wait:14}
I can guide you...
through Solaris..."

#### 81 ####
Elly
"What are you...?{wait:14}
Wait, I didn't mean it
like..."

#### 82 ####
Elly
"...{wait:1E}
Yes..."

#### 83 ####
Bart
"You want me to come?"{wait:14}
    Change
    Don't change

#### 84 ####
Bart has joined the party!

#### 85 ####
Bart
"I don't like the idea of
working for free...{enter}
...but I don't like the
idea of turning tail and
running from them even
more!{enter}
Let's do it!{wait:14} It doesn't
matter who they are. I'll
take'em all down in my
{name:0F:ブリガンディア}!!"

#### 86 ####
Billy
"Should I come along?"{wait:14}
    Change
    Don't change

#### 87 ####
Billy has joined the party!

#### 88 ####
Billy
"I will go too!{wait:14} The enemy
was able to get in because
they let the Yggdrasil in.{enter}
We can't allow the people
of this country to be in
danger because of us..."

#### 89 ####
Billy
"Shut up!{wait:14} Dad, could you
not say anything!?"

#### 90 ####
Rico
"You want me to go?"{wait:14}
    Change
    Don't change

#### 91 ####
Rico has joined the party!

#### 92 ####
Rico
"Tch. Since the day I met
you all, there's been
nothing but trouble...{enter}
But I've come this far with
you all. I guess there's no
point in bitching about it.{enter}
I'll show them what happens
when they tick the great
Rico off."

#### 93 ####
Citan
"Should I come along?"{wait:14}
    Change
    Don't change

#### 94 ####
Citan has joined the party!

#### 95 ####
Citan
"The Solaris Gear units are
on a high speed...{enter}
...interception course with
Shevat.{enter}
It would be reasonable to
believe that their main
targets are going to be the
4 Gate generators.{enter}
They are probably planning
on finishing us off since
Dominia's demolition has
weakened the Gate output.{enter}
We have scrambled our
interceptor units, but I
do not know how they will
fare...{enter}
The people of Shevat are
not accustomed to Gear
tactics.{enter}
I want to avoid unnecessary
sacrifices if at all
possible."

#### 96 ####
Citan
"Here is the breakdown of
the enemy Gear units...{enter}
As I have explained before,
4 separate units are each
headed for their respective
generators.{enter}
From the information
collected in Shevat...{enter}
...we have a good idea
of the capabilities and
composition of the Gear
units...{enter}
However, there is one giant
Gear that they are holding
back that we have no
information about."

#### 97 ####
Citan
"Maria, this is where you
and {name:13:ゼプツェン} come in.{enter}
Now that the Gate is
weakened, we can use
{name:13:ゼプツェン}'s heavy
particle cannon...{enter}
...to distort space
and neutralize the Gate
for a brief moment!{enter}
Upon penetrating into
Solaris, it would be best
to move about...{enter}
...in small groups so that
we do not attract
attention.{enter}
Well, if possible I would
like to..."

#### 98 ####
Citan
"Understood!{enter}
Then Elly, Fei, and I will
move about together.{enter}
The rest will form a
separate group to sneak in.{enter}
Maria, it looks like you
and {name:13:ゼプツェン} will wait
outside on standby."

#### 99 ####
Citan
"Well, let us break up
for now.{enter}
Once you are all ready,
we should all meet here
before we take off..."

#### 100 ####
Are you prepped and ready?
    Let's go!
    Not yet

#### 101 ####
Citan
"Good.{wait:14}
Then we are off."

#### 102 ####
Citan
"We are depending on you,
Maria.{enter}
Please transport us to
Solaris on the
{name:13:ゼプツェン}."

#### 103 ####
Citan
"Please hurry.{wait:14}
We are taking off the
moment you are ready."

#### 104 ####
Citan
"I am sorry.{enter}
I did not want to say
anything until I was sure.{enter}
I was on a secret mission
by orders of Emperor Cain
to monitor Fei.{enter}
He ordered me to determine
whether Fei would be a
threat to the world or not.{enter}
'The Contact'...
That is what the Emperor
calls Fei..."

#### 105 ####
Citan
"The emotional portion of
Fei's present personality
was sealed up by...{enter}
...his father through
some method...{enter}
And now with the cleared
foundation of Id's
personality... In computer
terms...{enter}
...it is like constructing
a mock personality on top
of the compatible portion
of the OS.{enter}
That is the reason Fei has
no memory of his past.{enter}
Those 10 or so years of
memories are under the
supervision of Id.{enter}
As long as Id does not
willingly hand over the
memories...{enter}
There is no way for Fei
to know since he did not
even exist before the
time Id was sealed up.{enter}
The present Fei's
personality is an
underdeveloped one which
was built upon within... {enter}
...the 3 years of living in
Lahan, studying and
acquiring other people's
reactions.{enter}
Hence, he does not know how
to fully cope with sudden
or emotional situations.{enter}
Elly, you are the one who
has spent the most time
with Fei so I would assume
you would understand this.{enter}
Were there not times when
he would be psychologically
unstable?{enter}
For example, he would be
manicly depressive and then
have sudden fits of
rage..."

#### 106 ####
Citan
"That is not what I am
saying. The present Fei
is one single personality.{enter}
It is just that structure-
wise, his personality was
constructed on top of
Id's...{enter}
...hence placing Fei at a
lower hierarchy.{enter}
That is why when Id is
active, Fei has no
recollection of it."

#### 107 ####
Citan
"Yes, if it were only Id
and Fei. But that does not
seem to be the case.{enter}
Id only manifests when
Fei's mental energy is in
a weakened state.{enter}
It is a mystery in itself
that the lower level
personality of Fei...{enter}
...has any control over
the upper level
personality of Id.{enter}
It is obvious that there
exists a third personality.
Id calls this existence
the coward.{enter}
In my observation, this
coward may be the
fundamental personality
of Fei.{enter}
In other words, Id's
manifestation is not
controlled by Fei...{enter}
...but is controlled by
the personality known
as the coward."

#### 108 ####
Citan
"At the same time Id 
resents this coward, he
also obviously fears it.{enter}
From a certain point of
view, this coward is the
one assisting in keeping
the present Fei in control.{enter}
I do not know the reason
why this third personality,
excuse me...{enter}
...Fei's fundamental
personality does not come
out...{enter}
If this one awakens, it
will become one with Id.{enter}
...In other words, there
is a possibility that the
complete original
personality...{enter}
...may be restored."

#### 109 ####
Citan
"Probably. But I do not
know how to awaken it.{enter}
Before I had the
opportunity, Id disappeared
and he has been like that
since.{enter}
Basically, as long as
nothing happens to Fei that
would challenge his
existence...{enter}
...Fei can be himself.{enter}
But his surroundings do
not allow him that
opportunity.{enter}
It would be best for him
to live in a place that
is peaceful..."

#### 110 ####
Jessie
"Go get'em guys."

#### 111 ####
Jessie
"Yeah, right on!
Go for it young'uns!
We're depending on you.{enter}
Especially since my life
also depends on it.
I have no intentions of
kickin' the bucket here."

#### 112 ####
Jessie
"Alright alright, I
know."

#### 113 ####
Jessie
"Why can't you be
more nicer?"

#### 114 ####
Jessie
"An unidentified giant
Gear...?{wait:14}
It can't be..."

#### 115 ####
Jessie
"Then his present
personality is but only a
temporary one?"

#### 116 ####
Jessie
"Then that means he might
eventually be overtaken
by Id?"

#### 117 ####
Jessie
"...Then that means,
what?"

#### 118 ####
Jessie
"Is that for sure?"
