Fei
"Huh?
This one won't
open either."

#### 2 ####
Fei
"What's this facility for?"

#### 3 ####
Fei
"The origin of time?"

#### 4 ####
Fei
"It's the data on the
memory bank?"

#### 5 ####
Fei
"That means we were
living for those elderly
people of Gazel?"

#### 6 ####
Fei
"You mean those mutants
getting disassembled at
that factory were too?"

#### 7 ####
Fei
"That's horrid...{wait:28}
How could they..."

#### 8 ####
Fei
"What?"

#### 9 ####
Fei
"Doc, didn't you also
find out..."

#### 10 ####
Fei
"Hey wait a minute.
It could've been luck."

#### 11 ####
Fei
"Elly, uh, uhmm..."

#### 12 ####
Fei
"Wh, what...!"

#### 13 ####
Fei
"Hey, you okay?
Elly. Elly...?"{clear:28}

#### 14 ####
Fei
"Elly!"{clear:28}

#### 15 ####
Fei
"Doc... Citan!"{clear:28}

#### 16 ####
Fei
"Damn!
Got us!"

#### 17 ####
Fei
"Elly!{wait:1E} Citan!{wait:1E}
Where are you!"

#### 18 ####
Fei
"Damn! No good!
It won't open."

#### 19 ####
Elly
(Why...is the
deactivation code for the
door lock known?){clear:05}

#### 20 ####
Elly
"How could a human...
live 10,000 years...?"

#### 21 ####
Elly
"They're transferring
and taking living data{enter}
via memory cubes to the
Ministry so they can use
them to resurrect their
bodies!?"

#### 22 ####
Elly
"Citan, 
how would you know that?{enter}
Not even the government
or the army know such
things!"

#### 23 ####
Elly
"Come to think of it, it
seems like we took the long
way here on purpose.{enter}
There must've been a faster
way to Bart and them.{enter}
Also, the route to get to
this block can't even be
downloaded on the map.{enter}
So how did we know what
streets we were on?"

#### 24 ####
Elly
"That's impossible.{enter}
First of all, that
partition we took to get
into this block.{enter}
That panel was displayed
to be a P4 facility.{enter}
Even a high ranking
officer of Solaris
can't get in here.{enter}
You think they'd
leave a facility like
that unlocked and open?"

#### 25 ####
Elly
"And you could open it?
Who exactly are you?"

#### 26 ####
Elly
"Something's wrong!{wait:28}
You were able to get into
Solaris under martial law,{enter}
sneak into the palace, get
through a P4 level door,{enter}
and even learn the purpose
of the P4 facility...{wait:1E}
How is that possible?"

#### 27 ####
Elly
"Even father. I'm sure it
was possible you were in
Solaris then."

#### 28 ####
Elly
"Even Jessie, who was also
in Solaris then,{enter}
didn't know the motive
behind the M Project.{enter}
So Citan, why do you know?
You know even more details
than Maria...something's
not right...I know it."

#### 29 ####
Elly
"I'm not done!"

#### 30 ####
Elly
"I should've noticed
sooner. Citan...{wait:28}
Who are you?"

#### 31 ####
Citan
"This way."

#### 32 ####
Citan
"This place was not meant
to be seen since the
origin of time.{enter}
This facility centers
around the Emperor and
the Ministry's longevity
experiments."

#### 33 ####
Citan
"Yes...{wait:1E}10,000 years ago.
Beings called humans were
born here.{enter}
The first were the Emperor
and the Ministry's elders.

#### 34 ####
Citan
"Now only the Emperor is
left. His destiny is to
never die.{enter}
However, the Ministry is
different.{enter}
Once, during the
Diabolos Invasion...{wait:1E}
the Ministry elders died
losing their bodies.{enter}
Now, the Solaris governing
Ministry exists as data in
memory banks.{enter}
Each of their personalities
are bits of data."

#### 35 ####
Citan
"Having neither flesh nor
souls they are just binary
numbers.{enter}
They both exist and do not
exist at the same time..."

#### 36 ####
Citan
"After the Fall, wanting
to resurrect their bodies,
and create a worthy vessel,{enter}
they transferred a research
facility that was once the
Soylent System on the land
to Etrenank.{enter}
Eventually the facility was
no longer only for the
Emperor's life and the
Ministry's resurrection,{enter}
but it began producing food
and drugs with additives
that controlled the public.{enter}
The memory cube Fei and
them were using was meant
for obtaining living data.{enter}
Of course, the 'Ethos' also
sent various data to help."

#### 37 ####
Citan
"Yes."

#### 38 ####
Citan
"Yes."

#### 39 ####
Citan
"Basically, they wish to
reuse the useless dregs."

#### 40 ####
Fei
"Doc, wait..."

#### 41 ####
Elly
"Hold on, Fei!
Something's not right!"
