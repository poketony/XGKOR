Citan
"I see...{enter}
So your 'young one' has
not just been shooting
at anything and every-
thing then, Sigurd."

#### 2 ####
Citan
"So, what happened to
this 'young one' you
call 'master'?"

#### 3 ####
Citan
"You seem to trust
him a lot..."

#### 4 ####
Citan
"It is not coincidence.
It is an inevitable
consequence...I assume."

#### 5 ####
Sigurd
"Yes, he actually
calculated this attack...{wait:10}
...or so he says!{enter}
As you can see...
no one has died this
time, either."

#### 6 ####
Sigurd
"Okay.{wait:10}
I'm counting on you."

#### 7 ####
Sigurd
"He fell into an under-
ground cave with that
other guy in a Gear.{enter}
It's near an old excavation
site, and he is riding in a
Gear, so he'll probably be
able to come up somehow...{enter}
We'll try to find him for a
while, and if that doesn't
work, then we'll wait for
him at our meeting point."

#### 8 ####
Sigurd
"Trust him...
Yeah, I trust he'll
get us into trouble."

#### 9 ####
Sigurd
"But I never thought I
would meet you here,
'Hyu'..."

#### 10 ####
Sigurd
"...{wait:20}Hyuga...
Are you saying something
is about to happen?"

#### 11 ####
Phew, thank god...
I didn't wanna dry up and
die up in the desert...

#### 12 ####
Shut up!
You sunk our ship!
Don't you forget that!

#### 13 ####
Hey, you!
I know you're tired but
don't go any further
than there!

#### 14 ####
No, you shut up!
Just be thankful that
you were saved!

#### 15 ####
Excuse me...

#### 16 ####
Is there anyone who is
almost dead, with no arms
and legs, or in need of
an abdominal operation!?

#### 17 ####
No one...? 
Well that's
depressing...

#### 18 ####
Sigurd, sir!
The collection of the goods
and soldiers from the Aveh
transport is almost complete.{enter}
We still can't locate the
young master... General
Maitreya's platoon will
scout around again.

#### 19 ####
Yes, sir!{wait:18}
Since I'm part of the unit
I'll also excuse myself.
