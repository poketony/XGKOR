To the next scene

#### 2 ####
When Fei and the others arrived
at the deepest part of Mahanon,{wait:1E}
I was looking after the newly
mutating people in Nisan{wait:05}...

#### 3 ####
People mutating, one
after the other...

#### 4 ####
Like some eternal nightmare
that made me wonder just
how long we would have
to keep on nursing them.

#### 5 ####
Margie
"Are you okay?"

#### 6 ####
Margie
"You haven't had
any rest have you?{enter}
I can handle things
on my own for a while.
Why don't you go out
for a walk?"

#### 7 ####
Elly
"Thank you.{wait:1E}
But I'll be alright.{enter}
I'd rather keep busy
so that I won't worry
about things too much."

#### 8 ####
Margie
"Is that it?"

#### 9 ####
Margie
"Hey!{wait:1E}
Elly, what's that?"

#### 10 ####
Elly
"This?"

#### 11 ####
Margie
"Can I see it?"

#### 12 ####
Margie
"Just as I thought...
It's the Pendant of Nisan.{enter}
But, why do you have it,
Elly?"

#### 13 ####
Elly
"It's Fei's. I'm holding
on to it for him...{wait:1E}
But...{enter}
It feels as if I have
always worn it..."

#### 14 ####
Margie
"Hmm..."

#### 15 ####
Margie
"When you wear that,
you look even more
like Sophia!"

#### 16 ####
Elly
"Really? Hmm...
Flattery won't get you
anything, you know?{enter}
Anyway, we need to hurry up
and test the new mutation
suppressant assembler on
those other people there.{enter}
We can't afford to have
them change any further."

#### 17 ####
Elly
"Ah!"

#### 18 ####
Elly
"Oh-no...
Something has happened
to Fei and the others!"
