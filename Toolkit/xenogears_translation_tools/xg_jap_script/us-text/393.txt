Oh, and you are...?{wait:14}
I feel like I've met you
before...{enter}
Hmm...you resemble Kahn,
the one who taught us the
art of fighting.{enter}
Nobody knows his
whereabouts after he went
down to the surface on
the Queen's mission...{enter}
I doubt something bad
happened to him considering
his skills.{wait:14}
But, I wonder where he is?

#### 2 ####
You just arrived from
the surface, didn't
you?{wait:14}
I've heard about you.{enter}
They say you saved our
colleague captured by the
'Ethos'.{wait:14} Thank you very
much for that.

#### 3 ####
I wish they'd give me a
mission!{wait:14} 
I'd teach those
Solarians a lesson...
