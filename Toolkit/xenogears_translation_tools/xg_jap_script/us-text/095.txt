Citan
"Good work. Get plenty
of rest for tomorrow."

#### 2 ####
Going out again?
    Yes
    Get some rest

#### 3 ####
Citan
"Are you sure?
Please do not come 
back too late."

#### 4 ####
Citan
"Good.
Save your energy
for tomorrow."

#### 5 ####
Citan
"Come back after you
have registered for
the Tournament."

#### 6 ####
Citan
"Good morning.
Operation 'Rescue Margie'
is now underway!"

#### 7 ####
Citan
"First Fei and I will
prepare for the Tournament
at the arena.{enter}
When the Tournament starts,
Bart will enter the water-
way through the well and
head for the castle.{enter}
If you swim against the
current you should reach
the castle.{enter}
I am certain there will
still be some guards
there, so please dispose
of them quietly.{enter}
We will make a good show
at the Tournament to draw
the guards' attention as
long as possible.{enter}
During that time, you can
rescue Margie."

#### 8 ####
Any questions?
    Got it
    Once more, please

#### 9 ####
Citan
"Then let us go.
Be careful, young one!"

#### 10 ####
Bart
"Fei, no matter what, 
you gotta win!"

#### 11 ####
Bart
"Well, I'm all ready so
I'm gonna get some sleep.
Man, I'm beat."

#### 12 ####
More sightseeing 
in Aveh?
    Yes
    Rest

#### 13 ####
Bart
"Really?{enter}
If we succeed tomorrow
I won't be  comin' back
here for a while."

#### 14 ####
Bart
"Yeah, tomorrow will be 
tough for both of us."

#### 15 ####
Bart
"Did you register for
the Tournament? What?{enter}
Not yet! Go hurry and
sign up."

#### 16 ####
Bart
"It's about to start!
I guess I better go
get ready too."

#### 17 ####
Is this plan really
going to work?

#### 18 ####
Bart
"It's already started. 
If something's wrong now,
then that's tough!{enter}
What're you worried about?
Fei'll do okay.
Besides Citan's with him,
too.{enter}
Now, all I gotta do is
sneak into the castle
through the well.
No problem."

#### 19 ####
I pray so.

#### 20 ####
Bart
"Well, I'm going.
Margie's waiting
in the citadel."

#### 21 ####
Well then...
do be careful.{enter}
And thank you for
helping Mother
Marguerite.

#### 22 ####
Bart
"No sweat!
You'd better get
outta Aveh now too.{enter}
Things are gonna get
outta hand soon."

#### 23 ####
Thank you.

#### 24 ####
!!{clear:1E}

#### 25 ####
What's going on!?
How dare you come into
other people's rooms
through the window...

#### 26 ####
Prince Bartholomew!

#### 27 ####
...I'm sorry. I heard
Prince Bartholomew was
coming here...{enter}
I just never expected
it would be through
the window...

#### 28 ####
Please come in.

#### 29 ####
Excuse me but
who are they...

#### 30 ####
{slow:01}Bart
"Oh, this is Fei and
Citan. They're going to
help rescue Margie."

#### 31 ####
Thank you for coming here
in this desert heat.
I am a servant of the
Nisan Sect.{enter}
Ever since Shakhan took
Mother Marguerite I've
been looking into ways
to get her back.{enter}
I've been trying to find
out where she is being
held.{enter}
I've been busy listening
to workers talk about
the comings and goings
from the castle...{enter}
And giving food to the
guards who are preparing
for the Tournament to
loosen their lips too.{enter}
Finally yesterday, I got
some information...
Margie's in the citadel.{enter}
The problem is how to 
slip into the castle...{enter}
I thought about it a lot
but it looks pretty bleak.
I'm sorry.

#### 32 ####
Bart
"No big deal. At least
we know where she is now.{enter}
You just relax, we'll
find a way to slip into
the castle."

#### 33 ####
My apologies. If there
is anything else I can do
to help just ask...{enter}
Do you have any good leads?

#### 34 ####
Did you find a way 
into the castle?

#### 35 ####
Did you find a way 
to use the festival?

#### 36 ####
Any new information?
Good ideas?

#### 37 ####
Any luck finding
the well key?

#### 38 ####
Bart
"Yeah, the old guy next 
to the well had it."

#### 39 ####
Citan
"Not yet. We are going
to look for it again."

#### 40 ####
Bart
"Not yet. We're gonna
hit the streets for
info. now.{enter}
Then we'll think
about the rest later."

#### 41 ####
I see. I'm very relieved
that you are all here.
Please come see me again
if you hear anything new.

#### 42 ####
Bart
"I just remembered where
Bledavik's water supply
comes from...{enter}
Spring water rises up from
under the castle and flows
to the town via a series
of underground waterways.{enter}
We can sneak into the
castle by going through
these underground
waterways.{enter}
We can get into them from
the town's well. The water-
ways should lead right up
to the castle's reservoir.{enter}
If we are able to get that
far, we should be able to
sneak into the other rooms
of the castle from there."

#### 43 ####
Citan
"A good idea, except I
have one more suggestion.{enter}
There is a festival going
on now. There must be a
way we can use it to our
advantage." 

#### 44 ####
£¡{clear:1E}

#### 45 ####
North of town is a
plaza. The castle is
beyond that.{enter}
I'm sure we'll find
something there.

#### 46 ####
Citan
"Tomorrow is the 
Tournament. There will
be betting at the arena.{enter}
Surely, the soldiers'
minds will be more on the
Tournament than their job.{enter}
We must use this to our
advantage."

#### 47 ####
What do you mean?

#### 48 ####
Citan
"Fei will participate.
We will have him put
on a big show there."

#### 49 ####
Bart
"Tomorrow's the Tournament.{enter}
Nothing's more popular than
gambling at these things.{enter}
All the guards will be
betting. They'll all be
gambling.{enter}
They'll be more interested
in the fight than their
jobs. We gotta use this.
Fei! You've gotta fight!"

#### 50 ####
Fei
"Huh? Me?"

#### 51 ####
Bart
"Everyone would know me.
Besides, I know the castle
well so I should sneak in."

#### 52 ####
I'm sure today's the
last day to sign up for
the Tournament. You'd
better register soon.

#### 53 ####
Citan
"No need to worry.
Fei already registered."

#### 54 ####
Citan
"Even if using that as a
ploy, how will you really
get into the castle?"

#### 55 ####
Bart
"...We gotta get more
info.{wait:1E} I'm sure we'll get a
good idea from somewhere."

#### 56 ####
Citan
"Very well.{enter}
If we get any good ideas
we will meet back here and
plan our strategy."

#### 57 ####
Citan
"Tomorrow Fei will be in
the Tournament at Fatima
castle.{enter}
We will put on a good show
to distract the guards.{enter}
Then Bart will infiltrate
the castle through the
underground waterways
by way of the well.{enter}
I will accompany Fei to
the Tournament. I will
also help work the crowd
and secure our escape."

#### 58 ####
Citan
"Sounds good.{enter}
Fei is in the Tournament.
He will draw the guards'
attention.{enter}
Then Bart will enter the
castle through the
waterways via the well.{enter}
After that he will rescue
Marguerite from the
citadel.{enter}
I will accompany Fei to
the Tournament. I will 
also help work the crowd
and secure our escape."

#### 59 ####
Citan
"...{wait:32}There is one problem.
The well is locked. First
we must find the key."

#### 60 ####
Bart
"Let's go find the key, 
and fast!"

#### 61 ####
Citan
"Preparations for our
plan are complete.{enter}
Tonight we will stay in
the hotel and start out
tomorrow.{enter}
We are free to do what we
like for now. 
Let us have a look around
the town."

#### 62 ####
Citan
"Now to register for
the Tournament.{enter}
Fei, pretend you are
looking around and
head for the castle."

#### 63 ####
Sorry I can't help you.

#### 64 ####
Please take care. 
I wish you the best 
of luck.

#### 65 ####
Please take care.
I will pray for
all of you to
return safely.

#### 66 ####
!{wait:1E}

#### 67 ####
Wh, who are you!?
Just barging into a
lady's room.
And from the window!{enter}
Oh, I think I'm going to
faint. How rude you are!{wait:1E}
What a dangerous town.
Get out, now!

#### 68 ####
What are you doing? 
Get out of here, now! {clear:1E}

#### 69 ####
No, don't come any 
closer! Get out, now! {clear:1E}
