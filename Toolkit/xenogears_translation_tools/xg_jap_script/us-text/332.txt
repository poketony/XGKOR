"...{wait:20}
There is some kind
of barrier.{enter}
Some kind of negative
feeling...hatred, somehow
changed into an Ether,
forming a barrier...{enter}
If we can somehow change
our strong force of will
into Ether also and throw
that back at it..."

Citan
"Th, that is a Buntline...{enter}
It is an Ether gun Gear

No, there's nothing there
for you to regret, Billy!

Grahf
"Grant unto thee the
power of the glorious
'Mother of Destruction'!"

Grahf
"I am Grahf, the seeker

Doth thou desire the
power?"

#### 18 ####
Grahf
"All this power is fake.
Do you think you can win
with it?"

#### 19 ####
Grahf
"A fake body.
A fake awakening.
It is all useless!"

#### 20 ####
Grahf
"I will give you
the power!"

Just take care of it 
and it'll be over..."

Repent now."

#### 23 ####
Stone
"Who, {wait:07}who are you?"

#### 24 ####
Stone
"Power?
Hmph, there's power,

Stone
"Ha...son of Jesiah, are
you suffering?{enter}
When I took you in 4
years ago, that was proof 
of my old friendship with 
your father...{enter}
In that hate stained
friendship with Jesiah,
we competed for command
of Gebler!"

#### 28 ####
Stone
"Jesiah, like a beast, you
stole the Racquel I loved,{enter}
and threw away the
command of Gebler that I
wanted so much, then
disappeared from Solaris!"

#### 29 ####
Stone
"Yes Billy, let me tell
you something good...{enter}
Those Reapers that you
have been purging are
really all people...{enter}
They were chosen by the
'Ethos' and converted
by Krelian!{enter}
You've been slaughtering
people! Ha ha ha...
A wretched son for a
wretched father!{enter}
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!"

#### 30 ####
Stone
"Ha, confess to me!
Pay for your sins!"
