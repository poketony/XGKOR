Ramsus
"I am Ramsus, she is
Miang. We would like to
ask you some questions."

Margie
"I'm Margie.
Actually it's Marguerite.
What do you want to know?{enter}
My favorite food? I like
cake, Chiffon Nisan is my
favorite. I haven't had
it in so long..."

#### 3 ####
Ramsus
"Marguerite, we want to
ask you about the Fatima
family treasure...{enter}
I'm talking about the
'Fatima Jasper'. You see,
I'm keeping the piece
you had in a safe place.{enter}
But I don't know where
the other piece is.
Do you?"

#### 4 ####
Margie
"Nope.
The one I had you took
from me.{enter}
You didn't even give
me anything for it.{enter}
Hey, the next time you
come, could you bring
some Chiffon Nisan?{enter}
I used to eat it
everyday in Nisan.
I don't think they
make it in Aveh.{enter}
Aveh used to have such
good bakers, but I
guess they must have
all died in the war."

#### 5 ####
Ramsus
"That is too bad.{enter}
I don't know much about
cake, but I'll see if I
can find some for you
next time."

#### 6 ####
Margie
"Thank you Ramsus.
I'll be waiting."

#### 7 ####
Ramsus
"Is there anything else
you need?{enter}
If there's something you
want I'll bring it next
time."

#### 8 ####
Margie
"No. I just want to go
back to Nisan. They must
be so worried about me."

#### 9 ####
Ramsus
"I'm sorry but please
wait a little longer.{enter}
We want you to stay
here until we find
the other half of the
'Fatima Jasper'."

Margie
"Bart!"

#### 14 ####
Bart
"Let's go
home Margie!"

#### 15 ####
Margie
"I just knew you'd 
come for me!"

#### 16 ####
Bart
"I'm getting
you outta here!
C'mon, follow me!"

#### 17 ####
Margie
"Okay."

#### 18 ####
Margie
"Oh, wait
a second."

#### 19 ####
Margie
"I really
like this."

#### 20 ####
Thank you so much
for rescuing Mother
Marguerite.{enter}
All of us in the Nisan
Sect are deeply indebted
to you.

#### 21 ####
Today we came to pray to
god for peace in Aveh,
Nisan and Kislev. {wait:3C}
Peace be with you all.

#### 22 ####
Please wait a moment.{clear:1E}

#### 23 ####
We are grateful to you
for rescuing Mother
Marguerite.{enter}
Thanks to you, we can
return to Nisan overjoyed.

#### 24 ####
Please wait a moment.{clear:1E}

#### 25 ####
We would like to build
Nisan churches in
Bledavik and Dazil.

#### 26 ####
Please wait a moment.{clear:1E}

#### 27 ####
This is the room 
Mother Marguerite was 
locked away in.{enter}
She must have been so
terrified.
