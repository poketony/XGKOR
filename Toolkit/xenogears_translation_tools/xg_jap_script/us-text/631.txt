"I knew it! Jesiah is
planning on using it!
He must be stopped!{enter}
Billy, can you hear me!?{wait:1E}
Billy!?...{wait:2D} No good...
There is no response!!"

Citan
"Too late...!
Billy!{enter}
That is a weapon that
uses its pilot as the
warhead!"

#### 4 ####
Billy
"Father..."

#### 5 ####
Billy
"What!?
Th, then,
father is...{enter}
...Oh my {wait:1E}god!!"

Jessie
"Billy, if we merge
our Gears
together...{enter}
...then we can break
through that barrier
with our combined
attack.{enter}
I'm gonna borrow your
shoulder for a moment,
so start aiming now."

Jessie
"Billy, you know
now don't you? {enter}
Stein's teachings
were all a deception.{enter}
That fabricated faith was
just a worldly system for
compensating those people
with fragile souls.{enter}
But, faith and god aren't
things which are given to
you from others, right?{enter}
They are things you
have to discover
within yourself,
and by yourself.{enter}
Things that cannot
be put into words,
things that cannot
be expressed...{enter}
Isn't that what god is
all about? 'Question
not thy god, for thy
god doth not respond.'"

Jessie
"The reason I taught you
how to use a gun as a 
child was to save people.{enter}
You say that guns
are just tools for
killing people.
But you are wrong.{enter}
'Guns' don't kill people.
'People' kill people.{enter}
Have you ever looked at
the expressions on the
faces of those reapers
you have destroyed?{enter}
It is an excruciating
process to be turned
into a reaper.{enter}
To ease their torturous
pain, they seek human
blood, and attack people
in order to get it.{enter}
But, that does not
vanquish the true pain
within their hearts.{enter}
There is only one way to
be saved from the pain.
That is by termination.{enter}
Didn't all those reapers
put out of their misery
by you have peaceful
looks on their faces?{enter}
Your gun saved those
people who were turned
into reapers. It's not
something anyone can do.{enter}
The faith that enabled
you to accomplish that
was no deception...
God exists within you!"

Jessie
"Alright, now!
Let's go,
Billy, go!"

#### 10 ####
Jessie
"Let's wrap this up once
and for all, eh Stein?{enter}
But, I want you to know
that you aren't gonna
see Racquel when you
die...!{enter}
That's because your
destination is going
to be hell!"
