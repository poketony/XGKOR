Citan, he was at the
Gear Shop..."

"I'm exhauschued chu!{wait:0A}
Since you're here...{wait:0A}
I'd like a massage!!{enter}
Just kidding..."

{name:07:¥Á¥å¥Á¥å}
"Elly, she was so kind...
I know I'm not the only
one chu miss her.{enter}
I know Bart, Margie,
Billy, Citan, Rico,
Maria, Emeralda, and
Fei all do chu...{enter}
Although they don't say
it, I can feel it...
Standing here, I remember
her kind and gentle smile.{enter}
Elly will return, won't
she?"

#### 4 ####
Fei
"...
Thanks, {name:07:¥Á¥å¥Á¥å}...{enter}
Thanks for trying to
reduce all this tension
in the air for me.{wait:05}
I'll remember this...{enter}
Anyway...{wait:05}
Elly's gotta be alive!
Right?"

#### 5 ####
{name:07:¥Á¥å¥Á¥å}
"Fei..."

#### 6 ####
Fei
"Let's go back to the room.
Margie seemed worried."

#### 7 ####
{name:07:¥Á¥å¥Á¥å}
"Okay.
I'll come chu!"

This is {name:11:¥·¥å©`¥Æ¥£¥¢}.
It's the Battling Champ,
Rico's Gear.{enter}
Height 19 sharls
Base Weight 20.8 kahnns
Full Weight 27.5 kahnns{enter}
Although it appears slow,
it's actually quite nimble
with the Grind-rollers.{enter}
Since it's built for
Battling, it's got the
best endurance.{enter}
The Drillclaw on the left
arm has the ability to tear
through steel plates of up
to 0.8 sharls.

#### 10 ####
This is {name:19:£Å¡¤¥·¥å©`¥Æ¥£¥¢}.
It is Rico's Gear.{enter}
Height 19.2 sharls
Base Weight 22.2 kahnns
Full Weight 26.7 kahnns{enter}
Like the other Omnigears,
it was at one point an Anima
Relic absorbed by Deus and
deactivated...{enter}
However, using the data taken
from Xenogears as a base, the
sages of Shevat, Balthasar
and Mechior, reconstructed it.{enter}
Thanks to that, its
capabilities have increased
compared to the prior version.{enter}
Its standard weapon is the
same as it was before its
reconstruction.

#### 11 ####
This is {name:0D:¥ô¥£¥¨¥ë¥¸¥§}.
It's the Gear for that
girl from Solaris.{enter}
Height 15.7 sharls
Base Weight 10.2 kahnns
Full Weight 14.7 kahnns{enter}
The frame along with the
armor have been minimized
for reduced weight.{enter}
But within all that lies
the impressive technology
of Solaris.{enter}
It's a lot more resistant
to damage than what its
appearance suggests.{enter}
Rather than physical
damage, it's more
specialized for Ether
attacks.{enter}
This is especially so with
the tail stabilizers and
equipped side skirts which
are used...{enter}
...for the explosively
damaging Ether guidance
weapons, 'Aerods'.{enter}
It basically reflects
that young lady's Ether
power directly.

#### 12 ####
{name:10:¥ì¥ó¥Þ©`¥Ä¥©}
It is Billy's Gear.{enter}
Height 15.9 sharls
Base Weight 11.6 kahnns
Full Weight 16.1 kahnns{enter}
It's still under
investigation so I
don't know the details.

#### 13 ####
{name:10:¥ì¥ó¥Þ©`¥Ä¥©}
This is Billy's Gear.{enter}
Height 15.9 sharl
Base Weight 11.6 kahnns
Full Weight 16.1 kahnns{enter}
Although on the outside
it looks like an 'Ethos'
-type Gear, inside, it
is entirely Solaris-type.{enter}
Since it's for Etone use,
that Stone character most
likely brought it here
directly after its
creation in Solaris.{enter}
But, because of that,
its capabilities are
really impressive.{enter}
Especially those anti-Wels
Revolver Cannons equipped
in both arms.
They are very destructive.{enter}
An average Gear would be
junk after taking one hit.

#### 14 ####
{name:18:£Å¡¤¥ì¥ó¥Þ©`¥Ä¥©}
This is Billy's Gear.{enter}
Height 18.8 sharl
Base Weight 14.9 kahnns
Full Weight 19.3 kahnns{enter}
Like the other Omnigears it
was at one point an Anima
Relic that was absorbed by
Deus and thus deactivated.{enter}
However, using the data taken
from Xenogears as a base, the
sages of Shevat, Balthasar and
Mechior could reconstruct it.{enter}
Thanks to that, its
capabilities have increased
compared to the prior version.{enter}
The standard weapon is the
same as before reconstruction.
Billy's father's Buntline
Cannon can still be used too.

#### 15 ####
{name:14:¥¯¥ì¥¹¥±¥ó¥¹}
It's Emeralda's Gear.{enter}
Height 15.4 sharl
Base Weight 9.7 kahnns
Full Weight 13.3 kahnns{enter}
This Gear's controls are
quite unique.{enter}
The colony of nanomachines
from Emeralda's body
physically merges with the
Gear for direct control.{enter}
Theoretically, this Gear
shouldn't require repairs
but it seems they don't try
to repair anything except
Emeralda herself.{enter}
So, we're left with no
other choice but to have
to maintain the Gear.{enter}
The surface hovering and
flight capabilties are
quite impressive.

#### 16 ####
This is...
huh, {name:07:¥Á¥å¥Á¥å}!?
What in the world
are you doing here!{enter}
You don't need any
maintenance work!!{enter}
You're in the way!
Go eat some food
and take a nap or
sumthin'!

#### 17 ####
Change this Gear's name?
    Yes
    Not now

#### 18 ####
Hmm, {name:07:¥Á¥å¥Á¥å} isn't
exactly an object.
There's nothing I can
do for you there.

"Y, you know..."

Bart
"Hey?"

...{clear:1E}

#### 22 ####
Bart
"Quit the silent treatment!{wait:0A}
I came here to apologize!"

#### 23 ####
Rico
"...{enter}
What's your problem!?
I thought I dealt with
you a while ago.{enter}
I'm not the type to
dwell on the past."

#### 24 ####
...

#### 25 ####
Rico
"I'm more concerned about
those two Gears there...{wait:0A}
Who the hell are you?{enter}
I'm amazed you tune them
to run so well!{enter}
I thought Fei and I were
the only ones who could
work Gears that well..."

#### 26 ####
Bart
"Wow you really are the
Battling Champ... {wait:05}Oops,{wait:05}
I mean ex-Champ...{enter}
I'm amazed how you can
tell how good a Gear is
just by looking at it."

#### 27 ####
Rico
"I guess you can't learn
all about the world inside
a dark prison.{enter}
Really interesting.{wait:0A}
I was gonna move on but
now I've changed my mind...{wait:0A}
Let me join you,{wait:05} boss."

#### 28 ####
Bart
"I guess it's alright..."

#### 29 ####
I thought it was about
time for you to come...

#### 30 ####
Elly
"It's no use trying
to stop me.{enter}
Even if it is you,
if you get in my way,
I have no choice but
to...!!"

#### 31 ####
Citan
"That is no way for a lady
to speak.{wait:0A} I just came here
to see you off."

?{clear:14}

#### 33 ####
Citan
"I refueled {name:0B:¥ô¥§¥ë¥È©`¥ë}.{wait:0A}
We are ready to go
anytime."

#### 34 ####
Elly
"...Citan."

#### 35 ####
Citan
"...But,{wait:0A} Elly,{wait:0A} you cannot
use your Gear while it is
under repairs."

#### 36 ####
Elly
"What?{wait:0A} Then{wait:0A} what am I...?"

#### 37 ####
Citan
"You know that Omnigear...{wait:0A}
What if you borrow it..."

#### 38 ####
Fei
"No way.{wait:0A} I can't take
Shevat's property
without permission..."

#### 39 ####
Citan
"Elly is the only
appropriate person
for the Gear.{enter}
Nobody else can
operate it."

#### 40 ####
No...

#### 41 ####
Elly
"Never!!
I won't ride it, ever!!"

#### 42 ####
Fei
"Elly...?{wait:0A}
What's wrong?"

#### 43 ####
Elly
"I'm so scared...{wait:14}
That's why...{wait:0A} I'll
never want to do it!!"

#### 44 ####
Citan
"This is a problem..."

#### 45 ####
How about if I
ride with you?

#### 46 ####
Fei
"Everyone...?"

#### 47 ####
Bart
"Sorry...{wait:0A}Fei."

#### 48 ####
Billy
"I'm sorry..."

#### 49 ####
Margie
"Sorry..."

#### 50 ####
Fei
"No...{wait:0A}
Thanks, everyone."

#### 51 ####
Citan
"Now, I know you hate to
leave, but we should get
going before dawn.{enter}
I did some work on the
radar, so it
should work fine!"

#### 52 ####
Citan
"...They have left..."

#### 53 ####
Emeralda
"Fei{wait:05}...{wait:0A}where{wait:05}..."

#### 54 ####
Citan
"They went far away."

#### 55 ####
Emeralda
"I{wait:05}...{wait:0A}go{wait:05}..."
