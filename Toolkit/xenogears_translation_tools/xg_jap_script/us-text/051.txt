Fei
"Huh? {wait:1E}
Ahh...well...
sort of..."

#### 2 ####
Fei
"Well...{wait:20}
I suppose you could
say I was hurt..."

#### 3 ####
Fei
"There is that
too, but..."

#### 4 ####
Fei
"It's the other stuff he
said...{enter}
What happened at Lahan...
was all planned to get me
to ride in that Gear...
Or so he claimed.{enter}
That's got me worried..."

#### 5 ####
Fei
"All I know is what the
maids at my home in Lahan
told me...{enter}
One night a strange masked
man carried me to Lahan.
I was heavily wounded at
the time...{enter}
In my delirium I called out
for my father...
That's all they could tell
me about my background.{enter}
I don't remember anything
of my father or my past...
So I guess I'm not really
all that lonely or sad..."

#### 6 ####
Fei
"Doc, before the village
was destroyed, I lived
without doubting myself.{enter}
But it's different now.{wait:20}
I don't...{wait:0F}know who I am.
I've never felt like this
before..."

#### 7 ####
Fei
"Doc, why didn't I notice
that I had no memories up
until now?"

#### 8 ####
Citan
"To get you to ride
in that Gear...?"

#### 9 ####
Citan
"Well we cannot do anything
as long as we are prisoners
...even if we wanted to."

#### 10 ####
Let us rest a little.
Maybe it will sort your
feelings out a little.{enter}
     Good idea
     Let's talk more

#### 11 ####
Let us rest a little.
     Good idea
     Let's talk more

#### 12 ####
Citan
"..."

#### 13 ####
Let us rest a little.
     Good idea
     Let's talk more

#### 14 ####
Citan
"How are you, Fei?{wait:0A}
Did you sleep well?"

#### 15 ####
Citan
"Sorry I messed up...
I was careless.{enter}
That Gear is a top
secret experimental
model from Kislev...{enter}
It was only natural
that Aveh would also
be madly searching
for it."

#### 16 ####
Citan
"Fei? Are you hurt?
You do not look so well."

#### 17 ####
Citan
"That man in black...spoke
of your father's fate...
Is that what is wrong?"

#### 18 ####
Citan
"Are you worried
about your father?"

#### 19 ####
Citan
"...{enter}
(It was him! No mistake...{wait:20}
That was no coincidence...){enter}
(Could it be that we are
approaching...{wait:20}the
-Time- of the{wait:10} -Gospel-...?)"

#### 20 ####
Citan
"(Majesty...
is this the end...?)"

#### 21 ####
Citan
"Look!
What is that...?"
