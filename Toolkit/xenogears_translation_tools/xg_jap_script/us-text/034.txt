Fei
"Sand buggy?"

#### 2 ####
Fei
"Going to the desert? Doc,
are you going to excavate
some ruins or something?"

#### 3 ####
Fei
"What does that have
to do with that Gear?"

#### 4 ####
Fei
"But..."

#### 5 ####
Fei
"Doc..."

#### 6 ####
Fei
"You can't pilot
a military Gear?
Why is that, doc?"

#### 7 ####
Fei
"What do you mean...'If you
aren't trained, you can't
pilot a military Gear.'?{enter}
(Wasn't that Gear we found
a military Gear?
So why could I get it to
work then, doc?)"

Citan
"A sand buggy is a special
type of vehicle designed
for the desert terrain.{enter}
Its tires will not get
stuck in the sand...
You really need them for
long desert trips."

#### 9 ####
Citan
"I see...
Well then, we will
come again later."

#### 10 ####
Citan
"Yes, that is right.
Do you have any we
can rent right now?"

#### 11 ####
Citan
"Well then, 
if I may."

#### 12 ####
Citan
"Fei, I am going into the
desert to search for parts
for {name:0B:¥ô¥§¥ë¥È©`¥ë}."

#### 13 ####
Citan
"The Kislev and Aveh armies
are confronting each other 
in the desert all the time.{enter}
There is talk that their
forces often break into
battle over the ruins."

#### 14 ####
Citan
"If I search the battle-
fields for the wrecks of
such army Gear...{enter}
...I should be able to
find the parts we need.{enter}
(Besides {name:0B:¥ô¥§¥ë¥È©`¥ë} is a
Kislev Gear, so we need
parts from Kislev Gears.)"

#### 15 ####
Citan
"Fei, you are such a
worrier. Things have
a way of working out.{enter}
You do not need to worry
so much. Why not go kill
some time at the bar
until I get back."

#### 16 ####
Citan
"Military and civilian
Gears are different in
their basic structure.{enter}
That is why you need
special training and
natural talent to use
military Gears."

#### 17 ####
Citan
"In your case Fei, it
is because your natural
talent is so prevalent."

#### 18 ####
The sand buggy you were 
waiting for is back.{enter}
Do you want to rent it?

#### 19 ####
Hm? Never saw you before. {wait:0A}
You want to rent out a
sand buggy too, heh?

#### 20 ####
Of course...the keys are 
in the ignition, you can 
take it now.

#### 21 ####
Hey, are you letting
him go out there alone?{enter}
Lots of fights break out
in the desert...it's a
real dangerous place.{enter}
I've heard about a group
of pirates riding around
attacking people on a
sand cruiser.{enter}
You really shouldn't let
him go out there by
himself.

#### 22 ####
Sorry, it's not back yet.
Please wait a little more.

#### 23 ####
Hm? Haven't met you before.{wait:0A}
So you want to rent out a
sand buggy too?

#### 24 ####
Sorry but all our buggies
are lent out now.{wait:0A} Do you
want to wait for one?{enter}
Some of those guys
hunting for parts should
be back soon.

#### 25 ####
It's best if you go out
there and try to find
him as soon as you can.

#### 26 ####
Please bring the sand
buggy back as soon as
possible. Thank you!

#### 27 ####
So when will you be
returning the buggy?

Civilian worker Gears have
no chance against military
worker Gears in excavating.{enter}
But even if we had a
military Gear, we wouldn't
be able to operate it...
