Bartholomew, I heard from
my husband.{wait:1E} Things were
pretty tough for you!{enter}
Oh...{wait:1E}
just thinking about...
Shakhan gets my goat!{enter}
You get him Bartholomew!

#### 3 ####
Not too many people are
returning to town.{wait:1E}
So business is a little...{enter}
But, {wait:1E}that must mean the
atmosphere is changing for
the better everywhere in
the country.{enter}
Not like before, {wait:1E}
where people were taking
refuge here.{enter}
Well if you think about
it that way...{wait:1E}
I think things might be
pretty good.{enter}
Oh, I keep talking and
talking.{wait:1E}
Sorry, hahahaha!

#### 4 ####
Lately, this town has
gotten lonely.{enter}
But I'm stubborn, I
won't close up shop!

"Oh well, there's nobody 
around.{enter}
I guess I'll just leave 
the money here."

    Items
    Accessories
    Nothing

#### 17 ####
Young master, the old man
from the Gun Room sent me
here for supplies.{enter}
If you want, I can also
get Gear parts you may
need. Just tell me.

#### 18 ####
Bart
"Whoa, good preparations!
If that's the case, please
get the parts we need."

need. Just tell me.

#### 20 ####
There's no souvenir
shop in this town...{enter}
This isn't a
tourist attraction?{wait:1E}
I guess not.

#### 21 ####
Sigh... That guy there...{enter}
Once in a while we get
those ignorant types
coming to our town.

#### 22 ####
They have no idea about
what kind of situation
we're all in.

#### 23 ####
I hate them...
Those people who are so
ignorant about what's
happening in the world.{enter}
Don't tell me you guys
are like that too?

#### 24 ####
This place has gotten
to be a pain.{enter}
My family is fleeing north
to the mountains.{enter}
I'm here to buy supplies.

#### 25 ####
I came here in the hopes
of finding some souvenirs.{enter}
In the off chance that
there is some military
clash, I'll hold out and
defend this place.{enter}
If Shakhan is crushed, the
country will change.{enter}
If that happens I'll go 
home, propose to my girl 
and start a new job.

#### 26 ####
Hey, aren't you the
young master?

#### 27 ####
Hey you!

#### 28 ####
Huh?

#### 29 ####
Huh!

#### 30 ####
It's Bartholomew!{enter}
Are you doing well?

#### 31 ####
Bart
"Good enough!"

#### 32 ####
Don't try to 
overdo it.{enter}
Hey, are those your 
friends back there?

#### 33 ####
Bart
"Yeah.
Fei and Citan."

#### 34 ####
Friends of the young master
are friends of ours.{enter}
Take your time and 
look around.

#### 35 ####
Bart
"Thanks."
