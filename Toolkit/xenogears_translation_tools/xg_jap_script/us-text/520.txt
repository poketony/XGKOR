#### 1 ####
Driving back the Solarian
interceptor forces, we
took to the floating
continent, Mahanon.
 
It was the central hull
of a colossal spacecraft
with a diameter of at
least 40 kelts.
 
Judging from the condition
of the hull, we estimated
the ship was thousands of
years old.

#### 2 ####
"Alien beings that came
to our planet from a far
off galaxy, aeons ago{wait:05}..."
 
Could it possibly have been
that our ancestors were the
passengers of this ship and
had crash landed here on
this planet{wait:05}...{wait:05}
 
It was determined, by
examining the inside
of the wreckage, that
some kind of accident
occured on this ship
about 10,000 years ago
...which forced it to
crash onto our planet.
 
Seeking god and his divine
wisdom...'Razael's Tree'...
which, it is said, lie here in
Mahanon, we proceeded further.

#### 3 ####
In the depths we saw
an alien form. It was
partially rotted and
petrified, a giant
grotesque being{wait:05}...{wait:05}
 
'It' gave off an
inexplicable air of
intimidation.
 
Perhaps it was more
than a gut reaction.
Perhaps it was the
fear of the 'Absolute'
that came from the
very depths of our
inherited instincts...
And then{wait:05}...{wait:05}
'It' attacked us.

#### 4 ####
The partially rotted
thing eventually
disintegrated.
 
We proceeded even
further leaving
that area behind{wait:05}...{wait:05}
 
We came to an enormous
cavern that was big
enough to swallow the
whole capital of Aveh.
In its center were two
gently glowing objects.

#### 5 ####
It was the source
of divine wisdom{wait:05}...{wait:05}
It was {wait:0A}'Razael's Tree'.
 
And the cavern itself
was the giant computer
called Razael.
 
The wisdom of god,
hidden within Razael...
We found the unthinkable
when we accessed its data.

#### 6 ####
A large unmanned strategic
weapon and its battalion of
terminal interface weapons,
travelling from star system
to star system.
And a gargantuan mothership
used to carry them...

#### 7 ####
These weapons were called,{wait:3C}
'Yabeh',{wait:05} the inter-planetary
strategic weapon system.
 
The construction of god's
ark... The army with which
to reign over the vast
universe... The creation of
the angel 'Malakh'...
 
What the Gazel Ministry was
looking for was right here.

#### 8 ####
According to the data, the
giant, rotting organism we
just defeated was in fact
the nucleus of this system.

#### 9 ####
We were on the verge of
accessing the data for
the object called...
 
        'Zohar'
 
...the central neural circuit
and power source controlling
the entire system, from the
weapons to the mothership...
 
When suddenly, 'HE' appeared.

#### 10 ####
Grahf, Krelian{wait:05}...{wait:05}It was
obvious they were after
the data that was recorded
in Razael.
 
If this data fell into
their hands{wait:05}...{wait:05}
 
They had to be stopped{wait:05}...{wait:05}

#### 11 ####
Krelian
"The data hidden within
Razael's Tree. Could
you move out of the way?{enter}
That data is beyond your
abilities..."

#### 12 ####
Fei
"We have to protect this
with our lives! {enter}
We can't let them have
the Razael Data!"

#### 13 ####
Citan
"You handle them!
I will try and extract as
much data as I am able to!"

#### 14 ####
Citan
"If something goes wrong,
I will destroy this place!"

#### 15 ####
Fei
"Ghu, gahh{wait:05}...{wait:05}"

#### 16 ####
Grahf
"It's over for you."

#### 17 ####
Grahf
"Regretful? But that is
to be expected. You are
incomplete."

#### 18 ####
Fei
"I, incomplete!?"

#### 19 ####
Grahf
"Yes. That which you
presently lack. Namely,
your lack of hatred.{enter}
It supresses your true
powers!"

#### 20 ####
Fei
"H, hatred{wait:05}...{wait:05}?"

#### 21 ####
Grahf
"The desire to destroy
another, the want to
annihilate and massacre.{enter}
That is hate. The source
of power!{enter}
One attains this desire
through the first
instance of destroying
another. A sublimation.{enter}
That sublimation is what
rekindles the hidden
power!{enter}
Clutching on to your
reasoning, holding back
your hatred, your desires.{enter}
Unleashing your true power
is but only a dream within
a dream for you..."

#### 22 ####
Grahf
"You know it to be true.{enter}
Did not that machine
respond when you held the
anger within your heart?{enter}
The one who draws out
that machine's power.{enter}
The soul of desire.
That is Id."

#### 23 ####
Grahf
"As you wished, you have
the mark of an assassin
by birth!"

#### 24 ####
Fei
"That's no true! That's
impossible!"

#### 25 ####
Fei
"I'm, I'm not Id!
I{wait:05}...{wait:05}"

#### 26 ####
Grahf
"It is time{wait:05}...{wait:05}"

#### 27 ####
Grahf
"I shall consume your soul
and bring out that power
to its utmost limit!"

#### 28 ####
Krelian
"Enough!"

#### 29 ####
Grahf
"Hm?
Why do you stop me?"

#### 30 ####
Krelian
"He is bait.{enter}
If you kill the bait the
little bird we wish to
catch will only escape.{enter}
My precious little bird,
the one 'who I cannot
fulfill my merciful prayer
without'.{enter}
{wait:05}...{wait:05}You understand, do you
not? 'Lacan'{wait:05}...{wait:05}"

#### 31 ####
Grahf
"{wait:05}...{wait:05}Do what you will."

#### 32 ####
Krelian
"We will crucify these
ones.{enter}
The place will be 
southwest of here,
on top of 
'Golgoda Hill'."

#### 33 ####
Krelian
"Bind the broken Gears!"

#### 34 ####
Citan
"Elly!?"

#### 35 ####
Fei
"You idiot!{wait:0A}
Why did you come here!?"

#### 36 ####
Fei
"Krelian's after you!{wait:05}
Forget about us!{wait:0F}
Run and save yourself!!"

#### 37 ####
Elly
"I came as I was told.{wait:1E}
I'm the only one you
need{wait:05}...{enter}
They have nothing to
do with this.{wait:05}
So let Fei and the
others go!"

#### 38 ####
Krelian
"How gallant you are,{wait:05}
Elhaym.{enter}
It's as if{wait:05} 'that scene
from the past has been
brought back to life
in the present'.{enter}
So, you came in an
Omnigear.{wait:1E}
That too is{wait:05}...{wait:05}
'her Gear'.{enter}
Hmmm{wait:05}...{wait:2D}
Allow me to confirm
something."

#### 39 ####
Krelian
"I'll consider what kind of
treatment your friends will
receive{wait:05}...{wait:05}on one condition.{enter}
...{wait:05}That you first defeat
these two men here with
that Gear you came in{wait:05}...{wait:0F}
How about it,{wait:0F} Elhaym?"

#### 40 ####
Fei
"Forget it, Elly!{wait:0F}
He's up to something!{wait:0A}
Don't accept it!"

#### 41 ####
Citan
"Fei is right!{wait:0F}
Krelian is not a man
of his word...{enter}
And he always has
ulterior motives when
he sweet talks someone!{enter}
What is more, those men
are fighting machines
created by Krelian.{enter}
Their combat skills are
immeasurable!{wait:0A} They are
not opponents you can
handle by yourself!{enter}
Do not take him up
on his offer!{wait:0A}
Escape while you can!!"

#### 42 ####
Krelian
"My my{wait:05}...{wait:05}
Such harsh criticism.
I am not that brutal.{enter}
So,{wait:05} what will it be Elhaym?{wait:0F}
Even if you were to try to
flee now, it is not likely
you would be able to{wait:05}...{enter}
You see{wait:05}...{wait:05}
I have this whole area
surrounded by my guards!"

#### 43 ####
Krelian
"Wouldn't it be logical to
take the choice where you
may still stand a chance{wait:05}...{enter}
...{wait:05}No matter how slight it
may be?"

#### 44 ####
Fei
"Don't do it, Elly!"

#### 45 ####
Elly
"Alright then{wait:05}...{wait:05}
I'll do what you say"

#### 46 ####
Krelian
"Good.{wait:05}
You are indeed my
precious little bird.{enter}
Now, get on with it!"

#### 47 ####
Fei
"No way{wait:05}...!{wait:1E}
Elly{wait:05}...!"

#### 48 ####
Krelian
"Her true awakening{wait:05}...?{wait:0F}
Or just merely{wait:05}...{wait:05}
'protecting her master'{wait:05}...?{enter}
Either way, it does not
alter the fact that she is
the -Mother- existence that
I have been searching for!"

#### 49 ####
Krelian
"Now men...
recover that machine.{enter}
Place priority on the
safety of the pilot.{wait:0F}
Use whatever it takes
to preserve her life!"

#### 50 ####
Krelian
"Well then,{wait:05} I shall be
taking this girl with me!{wait:0A}
As for the rest of you{wait:05}...{enter}
Why don't you just wallow
there pathetically while
you meditate on your own
lack of any real power."

#### 51 ####
Grahf
"Pitiful{wait:05}..."

#### 52 ####
Grahf
"You can't even protect
a single woman.{enter}
It is not even worth
the effort of putting a
spineless wretch like
you out of your misery!"

#### 53 ####
Elly was taken away{wait:05}...{wait:0F}
And, as Krelian had told
her, we were left alive{wait:05}...{wait:2D}
 
Was Krelian just keeping
his promise{wait:05}...{wait:0F}
No, that can't be it{wait:05}...{wait:3C}
 
There had to be another{wait:05}
'real'{wait:05} reason why he
allowed us to live{wait:05}...

#### 54 ####
And we had to find that out{wait:05}...
