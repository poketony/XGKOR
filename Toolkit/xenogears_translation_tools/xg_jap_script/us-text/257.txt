Citan
"Oh, young one.{wait:0A}
Did you want to
talk to me?"

#### 2 ####
Bart
"Um...{wait:05} About my shooting
down the Goliath...{wait:0A} I'm,{wait:05}
errh,{wait:05} really,{wait:05} errh{wait:05}..."

#### 3 ####
Citan
"Oh, is that it?
I guess it could not be
helped...{enter}
But, jumping the gun is
your bad habit.{wait:0A}
A king should always keep
calm and judge carefully!"

#### 4 ####
(Maison says the same thing.)

#### 5 ####
Bart
"Yeah, I know, I know!{wait:0A}
By the way, I have
something to ask you..."

#### 6 ####
Citan
"Oh?{wait:0A}
That is unusual."

#### 7 ####
Bart
"Well, it's about this
warship we're on...{enter}
...which is the same type
as the Yggdrasil.{enter}
Years ago, my old man told
me it was scrapped because
the peace talks with Kislev
made progress.{enter}
So I knew it existed..."

#### 8 ####
Citan
"Hmm.{wait:0A}
Then, what is
bothering you?"

#### 9 ####
Bart
"The symbol on the ship...{wait:0A}
It's not our Royal Crest!{wait:0A}
Look at this."

#### 10 ####
Citan
"This is..."

#### 11 ####
Bart
"I thought you knew it.{wait:0A}
Whose crest is it?"

#### 12 ####
Citan
"I am not positive but
it looks like Shevat's."

#### 13 ####
Bart
"Shevat?{wait:0A}
What do you mean?"

#### 14 ####
Citan
"The Yggdrasil may not
have been made by your
father.{enter}
At that time, much of the
potential technology was
not understood and hence,{wait:0A}
was hidden.{enter}
Maybe your father might
have been scared of its
power and so sealed it
away."

#### 15 ####
Bart
"Hmm, I see.{wait:0A}
So this may not have been
ours from the start.{enter}
If so, I wanna meet
the guys who made this
amazing baby."

#### 16 ####
Citan
"Actually, they may
be closer to you
than you suspect..."

#### 17 ####
Bart
"Huh?{wait:05}
What did you say?"

#### 18 ####
Citan
"Nothing...I was just
wondering if Fei and
Elly are alright."

#### 19 ####
Bart
"...{wait:0A}
Sorry, it's my fault."

#### 20 ####
Citan
"N, no,{wait:0A}
I did not mean to...{enter}
I am sure{wait:0A} they are fine."

#### 21 ####
Bart
"Though there's no proof to
back it up, I feel better
now that you said that...{enter}
Even though I know you're
probably lying through your
teeth to make me feel less
worried..."

#### 22 ####
Citan
"Anyway, enough worrying...{wait:0A}
But I do think you should
apologize to Rico.{enter}
You may get more than a
bruise this time though."

#### 23 ####
Bart
"Yeah."

#### 24 ####
Citan
"Rico was checking
on his Gear."

#### 25 ####
What do you wanna do
with your Gear?

#### 26 ####
Come again.

#### 27 ####
Oh, Bart!
Thank you for letting me
ride on your Yggdrasil!{enter}
I've always wanted to ride
it... It's OK. The children
are safe in Nisan's care!

#### 28 ####
I heard there was a
shortage of people so I
decided to participate!{wait:0A}{enter}
Actually, I got fed up
with my job in the small
hideout...

#### 29 ####
What do you wanna do
with your Gear?

#### 30 ####
You must come back
now, ya hear!?

#### 31 ####
Come again!

#### 32 ####
If something should
happen, I'll go too!
That's the spirit of
Yggdrasil Gear troops!

#### 33 ####
I no longer have a place
in Gear combat, but I'd
better be ready for it
anyway!

#### 34 ####
I'll go buy parts for the
Gears.{wait:0A} General Maitreya'll
be upset if we don't try 
to put another Gear unit
together.

#### 35 ####
Hey, you haven't seen
Maria's Gear, have you?{enter}
It's too big to fit in
this hangar, so it's on
the deck.{enter}
Speaking of which...{enter}
Do you wanna change the 
name of {name:13:ゼプツェン}?
    {fast:FF}Yeah, why not!?
    No, not now...

#### 36 ####
General Maitreya,
Falkon and Farrant
are gone.{wait:0A}
...I miss them.

#### 37 ####
We don't have enough
underwater equipment,
Gears, or pilots.{wait:0A}
I'm glad you're here.

#### 38 ####
When I come here at night I
sometimes hear Maitreya and
them talking and laughing.{enter}
But when I get closer, the
voices disappear.{wait:0A} I'm sure
they are lonely,{wait:0A} too.

#### 39 ####
Maitreya admired your
dive technique.{wait:0A}
I hear your zoom
technique is flawless.{enter}
Do you think you
can train me on
my next watch?

#### 40 ####
Now, I must ready the Gear
parts.{wait:0A} Maitreya's strict
with this sort of thing.

#### 41 ####
That Gear with the
slender build withstood
{name:0F:ブリガンディア}'s rod?{enter}
What kind of armor did
they use to cover it?

#### 42 ####
Hey? Did you see this month's
edition of "Gear Fan Magazine"?{wait:0A}
They say, 'Hovering' is all
the rage right now'!{enter}
Until a while back, it used
to be special equipment that
only the young master had
equipped on his Gear!
