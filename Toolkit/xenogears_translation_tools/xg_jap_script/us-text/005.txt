#### 1 ####
Good day. 
I'm the village consultant.{wait:14}
(But to tell you the truth,
the village chief knows far
more than I do...{enter}
However, the chief is an
awfully busy person, so I
have been placed in charge
of answering some of the
more mundane questions.)

#### 2 ####
As a special for this week,
we are lecturing on the
techniques of "Marshal Art's"
self defense.{wait:14} Wouldn't you
like to learn about it?

#### 3 ####
What can I do for you today?

#### 4 ####
    {fast:FF}Explain battle commands
    Explain 'Defense' option
    Explain 'Action Points'
    Explain 'Attack' option
    Explain 'Combo' option
    Nothing now, thanks. 

#### 5 ####
Alright then.
Allow me to explain the
overall battle commands.

#### 6 ####
During battle, there are two
groups of commands you can
choose from.{wait:14} You can toggle
between groups with the Left
& Right Directional buttons.{enter}
The first group includes the
most frequently used Attack,
Defense and Chi options.{wait:14}
The second group contains
special commands such as
Combo, Escape and so forth.{enter}
You fight by skillfully
selecting from the two
groups of options the
action that best suits
your circumstances.{enter}
Normally, you should be
able to get by with just
the first group of options.{wait:14}
The item option is in both
sets, so you don't have to
switch groups to use items.

#### 7 ####
...Well, that pretty much
wraps it up.{wait:14} Please come
back again whenever you
need my services.

#### 8 ####
Oh I see, I see. You wish
to inquire about Defense?{wait:14} 
Well allow me to begin...

#### 9 ####
By choosing 'Defense', you
can halve the damage your
opponent does to you.{wait:14}
Fighting is not just about
being on the offensive - at
times it pays to hold back.{enter}
When you find yourself in a
pinch, it may be a good idea
to leave the attacking up to
your other party members and
simply choose to defend
yourself from enemy attacks.

#### 10 ####
...Well, that's about it.{wait:14}
Oh, and if you have any
other questions, please
feel free to stop by any
time now, you hear!?

#### 11 ####
Aha! I knew you were going
to ask me about them! {wait:14}
Well then, allow me to
explain about Action Points.

#### 12 ####
There are three kinds of
attacks - Weak, Strong
and Fierce - each using
up a set amount of Action
Points when performed.{enter}
When all your Action Points
are used up, your turn will
end. Conversely, as long as
you have Action Points left,
you may continue to attack.{enter}
In other words, Action
Points represent how many
attacks you can perform in
one turn of combat.{enter}
In the beginning, you
will only start out with
3 Action Points. However,
as you increase in level,
your Action Points will
increase accordingly.{enter}
The secret in putting up a
good fight lies in how you
utilize your Action Points
- what strengths of attacks
you use, and in what order
you dish them out in...!

#### 13 ####
...Well, that's it in a
nutshell.{wait:14} Oh, and don't
hesitate to ask if you
have any other queries!

#### 14 ####
My, you are bold!{wait:14}
Okay then, allow me to
explain to you a little
about attacking.

#### 15 ####
I am sure that you already
know that there are 3 types
of Attacks - Weak, Strong
and Fierce - each of which
uses up a different amount
of Action Points.{enter}
The Fierce Attack (¡Á button)
uses up 3 points in a single
blow. Hence, if you have only
3 Attack Points, all will be
used up in one Fierce Attack.{enter}
The Weak Attack (¡÷ button)
will use up 1 point per blow.
So, with 3 Attack Points, you
can attack the same enemy 3
times in rapid succession.{enter}
The Strong Attack (¡õ button)
uses up 2 points per blow.{wait:14}
So, if you've got 3 Attack
Points, you can combine one
Strong Attack with one Weak
Attack to total 3 points.{enter}
It is possible to continually
press the ¡Á button to keep
obliterating enemies in one
Fierce blow, but you may find
out that relying on this will
have repercussions later.

#### 16 ####
...That's about all I have
to say about that, really.{wait:14}
Please come by again when
you're in need of advice.

#### 17 ####
Ooooh! The 'Combo' option,
eh?{wait:14} I didn't expect you to
ask about it! Well then,
allow me to explain the
art of the 'Combo'.

#### 18 ####
When you use the Attack
option, there are times
when you do not use up
all your Action Points.{enter}
Such is the case when
you eliminate an enemy
by using only a fraction
of your total points, or
when you cancel midway
through an attack turn.{enter}
Action Points which don't
get used are stored in an
'AP Counter'. When this AP
Counter stores up a certain
amount of points, you will
become able to use 'Combos'.{enter}
'Combos' are rapid series of
Deathblows let loose all at
one time, and they tend to
be rather ferocious. Any
foe on the receiving end of
a 'Combo' will likely die.{enter}
At low experience levels,
you probably won't be able
to do much 'Combo' damage.{wait:14}
But in time you will become
able to do some devastating
'Combo' maneuvers!

#### 19 ####
...And that's that!{wait:14}
So, if you need any
other advice, you
know where I am!

#### 20 ####
I see. Well anyway...
feel free to ask me
anything, anytime!

#### 21 ####
Ahem!{wait:0A}
AHEM!

#### 22 ####
So as not to bother other
clients, please keep all
personal conversations
down to a minimum!

#### 23 ####
When it comes to fighting
techniques, I tend to be
extremely fussy!{wait:14}
I've started to study up
on them recently...

#### 24 ####
How 'bout it then?
Wanna hear what I have to say?{wait:14}
    {fast:FF}Explain 'Abilities'
    Explain 'Deathblow Skills'
    Explain 'Skill Levels'
    Forget it!

#### 25 ####
Hmmm, you're pretty
scholarly for a young'un.
Good, now listen up!

#### 26 ####
That 'Guided Shot' ability
you already have is one of
the many mysterious powers
related to Ether and Chi.{enter}
Not everyone has the
talent to use such powers.
People are each born with
differing innate abilities.{enter}
If that individual does
have the gift, increasing
in level will give birth
to more powerful abilities.

#### 27 ####
Hmm.{wait:14} I see a lot of
potential in you.

#### 28 ####
Good, good.{wait:14}
Ask away young'un!

#### 29 ####
As you already know, there
are 3 strength levels for
the ordinary Attack option:
Weak   Attack (¡÷ button),
Strong Attack (¡õ button) and
Fierce Attack (¡Á button).{enter}
'Deathblow Skills' are special
chains of Attacks that first
use some Weak or Strong blows
to knock your foe off balance
and then end with a Fierce
blow to do some major damage!{enter}
But first you must master
the use of Weak, Strong
and Fierce Attacks in order
to become able to learn
such 'Deathblow Skills'.{enter}
To master these Attacks, you
should keep trying to do, say,
four Weak blows in a row, or
two Strong blows, or even a
Fierce blow accompanied by
another type of blow.{enter}
In other words, the way to
learn new 'Deathblow Skills'
is through the frequent use
of various combinations of
the three basic Attacks!

#### 30 ####
So, whatcha' think?
Doesn't it just make ya want
to go out there now and start
learning those 'Deathblow
Skills' as soon as possible!?

#### 31 ####
Alright, here we go!{wait:14}
More about Deathblows
and their relation to
Experience Levels...!

#### 32 ####
If you want to see how
close you are to learning
certain 'Deathblow Skills',
go to the Menu Screen and
then to the Status Screen.{enter}
From the Status Screen you
can select 'Skills' to view
a list of your Deathblows,
with meters showing the
percentage learned so far.{enter}
If one of the Deathblows
just doesn't seem to be
increasing, then you're
probably using the wrong
types of Attack buttons.{enter}
In that case, it might be
best to try those Attacks
you normally haven't been
using. So experiment with
different attack patterns!{enter}
But remember this...!
Some 'Deathblow Skills'
cannot be obtained until
you have reached a certain
level of experience!{enter}
If you have not attained
that experience level, then
it won't matter even if the
Deathblow's meter has
reached 100%...!{enter}
In this case, you will have
to wait until your level of
experience increases before
you will be able to learn
to use that Deathblow!

#### 33 ####
... And that's about it.{wait:14}
If you keep up in your
studies, you're bound
to go far!

#### 34 ####
Here you go...{wait:14}
This is an allowance for
being such an enthusiastic
scholar!{wait:14} Hah hah hah!

#### 35 ####
Received 80G!

#### 36 ####
Buy some pencils and
books with that, OK!?{wait:14} 
Stick with it, kid!

#### 37 ####
Oh well... You can never
be too old to study.{wait:14} There
are mountains of things to
learn out there, young'un!

#### 38 ####
Don't tell me!{wait:14}
It's about the
'Memory Cube',
right?

#### 39 ####
Oh good, good!{wait:14}
You're lucky, you came
just at the right time...{enter}
If it's about the 'Memory Cube',
then don't hesitate to ask me.
No one knows better than I do!

#### 40 ####
How about it then?
Want to hear me out?{wait:14}
    Yeah, okay!
    No, not really!

#### 41 ####
Alright! Good show!
That's the spirit!
You're pretty smart
for an artist.{enter}
Now, open up those
ears and carve every
word I say into that
tiny brain of yours!

#### 42 ####
I'll begin by explaining
how to save your adventure.{enter}
Normally, you can open up
the Menu Screen by pressing
the ¡õ button.{wait:14} From there
you can select the 'File'
option, and simply follow
the directions to save.{enter}
However, when you are in a
town or a dungeon, you can
only save at designated
Memory Cube areas.{wait:14} Without
a Cube you cannot save!

#### 43 ####
{fast:FF}To make a long story short...
This bobbing, spinning thing is
a 'Memory Cube', right!? You
must be cool, calm and collected
to superimpose yourself with it
and boldly open the Menu Screen.
If you accomplish that you will
be able to save successfully.
You should always save without
hesitation whenever you find
one of these in the dungeon.
In life, you can never tell
what may lie around the corner! {clear:8C}

#### 44 ####
So, what do you think?
You understood everything
perfectly, then!?{wait:14}
Okay, well I gotta...{enter}
Wha?
You didn't understand?{wait:14}
Aww gee...{wait:14} Well alright,
let me explain once more!

#### 45 ####
Alright, this time, make
sure you're listening then!{wait:14}
This spinning and bobbing
thing here is the Memory
Cube I just spoke about.{enter}
Fearlessly stand inside of
the Cube's area and calmly
and composedly open up the
Menu Screen! From there you
will be able to save into a
memory file as per normal.{enter}
Especially in dungeons and
other like areas, as soon
as you see one of these,
you should save without
hesitation. You never can
tell what may happen next!{enter}
When outside on the World
Map, you can save anywhere
you like (... probably)!
If you don't want to wind
up crying later, make sure
you save frequently, okay!?

#### 46 ####
So, that's it for
my concise summary!{wait:14}
You took it all in this
time, didn't you...?{enter}
Well, even a 2 year old
Dongarian Monkey could
understand my fantastic
explanation 120%, right!?

#### 47 ####
Hooh-ho-ho!{wait:14}
I'm such a genius!!

#### 48 ####
And now, about the
explanation fee...{enter}
Ha-haa! Just kidding...{wait:14}
You didn't think the great
Lucca would be that mean
did you?{enter}
This time I'll give you a
special deal and let you
have that one for free!

#### 49 ####
And you owe me 28G!
Don't forget that, okay!?

#### 50 ####
Alright, now for the
explanation fee...
it's 28G!{enter}
28G is a bargain considering
you were able to receive
such a perfect explanation
from the likes of me!!!{enter}
So c'mon, drop the excuses.
Be a man and pay up!

#### 51 ####
Had 28G taken from you!

#### 52 ####
Yes, thank you so much...{wait:14}
No receipts given though!

#### 53 ####
What the...!?
You don't even have 28G?{enter}
I guess I have no choice...{wait:14}
You'll have to owe me then.{enter}
Don't forget, you now owe
me 28G! You got that, Fei?

#### 54 ####
Owe Lucca 28G!

#### 55 ####
What!?{wait:05}
You won't hear what I
have to say!
Don't you want to know!?{enter}
The logical, comprehensible
and downright beautiful
lecture given by me,{wait:05} the
one and only great Lucca,{wait:05}
can only do you good...!{enter}
... No matter how many
times you listen to it!{wait:14}
Oh, what a waste!{wait:14} Well...
don't come crying to me
when you run into trouble.

#### 56 ####
What!?{wait:05}
You won't hear what I
have to say!
Don't you want to know!?{enter}
The logical, comprehensible
and downright beautiful
lecture given by me,{wait:05} the
one and only great Lucca,{wait:05}
can only do you good...!{enter}
... How will you ever know
unless you hear it out!{wait:14}
Oh, what a waste!{wait:14} Well...
don't come crying to me
when you run into trouble.

#### 57 ####
Oh, and you owe me 28G!{wait:14}
You haven't forgotten
that have you, Fei?{enter}
I'm not going to let you
get off so easily if you're
trying to get out of paying
your debt. You got that!?

#### 58 ####
Did you know that you can
spin the world around with
the L1 and R1 buttons!?{wait:14}
I'm sure you'll see things
you weren't able to before!{enter}
Explore the world by using
your own eyes and ears!{wait:14}
That is how you make the
gains in your life truly
your own!{enter}
If you're lost, then be
lost!{wait:14} There is no need to
rush, is there?{wait:14} Nor do you
have to explore the world
using someone else's maps!

#### 59 ####
I come here often to talk
to the village consultant.
He usually gives good advice.{enter}
Although, once in a while
he can be a little absent-
minded...{enter}
Just recently, he mixed-up
the love potion with the
balding potion...

#### 60 ####
Hehe...{wait:14} Yes, sir!
Whatever you say!

#### 61 ####
We'll have to continue
this conversation later!
