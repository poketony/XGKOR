Kim
"Stupid! Idiots!
A bunch of fools!"

#### 2 ####
Kim
"I don't care if they
hear me. All the people
here are also fools!"

#### 3 ####
Kim
"Think about it.{enter}
What's the purpose of
fighting each other on
such a tiny planet as
this?{enter}
Fighting out of fear
of being hunted into
a corner...{enter}
Rushing in to fight as
if there were only so
many 'reserved seats'
to the right of life..."

#### 4 ####
Kim
"Starting a war is stupid.
Inciting it is also stupid.{enter}
Killing people as an act of
terrorism or as a protest
against wars that kill
people is just as stupid.{enter}
You're all fools!"

#### 5 ####
Kim
"Is that a good enough
reason for that child,
or those dead people?{enter}
It wasn't much of an
operation. It was
difficult but there was
enough chance to win...{enter}
We'd have won if we had 
better equipment...{enter}
That child would have
been saved if there
was electricity..."

#### 6 ####
Kim
"It's not just that child.{enter}
Five people died in my 
hospital.
The ICU didn't function..."

#### 7 ####
Kim
"Stupid. Just fools.
Humans, creatures are
meant to live.{enter}
Why do they want to
die out?
Why do they strangle
themselves?{enter}
Humans are defective
creatures.
A bunch of fools!{enter}
That's why genetic damage
is up lately. The birth
rate is also going down.{enter}
Only 30 years to live...
Nature, this planet, won't
allow humans to live any
longer than that."

Kim
"Huh...?"

Kim
"..."

Elly
"Kim...you're too loud."

#### 11 ####
Elly
"Kim!!"

#### 12 ####
Elly
"...Kim, I felt sorry for
that child.{enter}
But I don't think people
in Ravine destroyed the
generator with that
intention.{enter}
They don't have any other
ways to express themselves.{enter}
The government is the one
to blame."

#### 13 ####
Elly
"..."

#### 14 ####
Elly
"Am I...a fool, too?"

#### 15 ####
Elly
"I had a physical at
the hospital today...{enter}
They said I can't have
children because of
hereditary genetic
damage."

#### 16 ####
Elly
"...I can't create life.
I am a creature waiting to 
become extinct.{enter}
...Am I also a fool?"
