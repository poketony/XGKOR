Maison
"Oh, young master!
You still haven't
rested yet?" 

#### 2 ####
Bart
"Old Maison, there is
one thing I want to
ask you."

#### 3 ####
Maison
"What is it?"

#### 4 ####
Bart
"Where was Sigurd born?"

#### 5 ####
Maison
"Young master, that..."

#### 6 ####
Bart
"He has blue eyes...
it's the Fatima Jasper."

#### 7 ####
Maison
"...Well...{wait:32}
It was long ago.{enter}
When his Majesty and
I were still young...{enter}
Long before his Majesty
knew my young master's
mother.{enter}
His Majesty was in love
with a certain girl
from a small religious
sect east of Aveh.{enter}
This sect was quite
different from Nisan and
the 'Ethos' but she was
very beautiful.{enter}
Then...
she just disappeared.
Later there were rumors
of her having a child."

#### 8 ####
Bart
"She disappeared?
Did father abandon her?"

#### 9 ####
Maison
"As far as I know, it was
the opposite. His Majesty
was abandoned."

#### 10 ####
Bart
"Sig is from Aveh's
eastern desert..."

#### 11 ####
Maison
"Indeed. When he was 10, he
was assigned to his Majesty
King Edbart, as a squire."

#### 12 ####
Oh my, Major Vanderkaum!
Bringing this thing
into the room...{enter}
It's going to be so
difficult to clean
with this here.

#### 13 ####
I thought Maison would
clean that up for me, 
but instead, when he saw
it, he got so excited.{enter}
Men...

#### 14 ####
{fast:FF}There's probably a guard outside...
    Open the door
    Just take a peek
