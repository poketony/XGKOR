"Roni Fatima?
Isn't that my ancestor?{enter}
So you're saying my
ancestor, Roni, fought
alongside Queen Zephyr
against Solaris...?{enter}
Hmm..."

#### 2 ####
At one point, Solaris and
its Gazel Ministry made up
of 12 elders...{enter}
...dominated the world
with more military might
than they have presently.{enter}
The people on the land were
treated like slaves...{enter}
If any of them resisted,
they were quickly and
mercilessly dealt with.{enter}
They treated the people as
if they weren't living
beings.{enter}
Eventually, people on the
surface began to rebel from
all parts and ultimately...{enter}
...led to the Solaris-Shevat
War of 500 years ago.

#### 3 ####
The great war that unfolded
between Solaris and Shevat,
500 years ago...{enter}
It was a heroic battle,
with the freedom and
independence of the land
dwellers at stake...{enter}
The rebel army, which
centered around Shevat...{enter}
...was successful at
attacking the inner citadel
of Solaris, but only with
tremendous sacrifices...{enter}
However, before we almost
made it, the unthinkable
happened...{enter}
A new enemy appeared that
even Solaris had not
anticipated.{enter}
That was when the nightmare
began. The nightmare never
seen before.{enter}
A nightmare that we pray we
would never have to see
again...

#### 4 ####
Diabolos...{enter}
The sudden appearance of the
mysterious army put a full
stop to the battle between
the humans, 500 years ago.{enter}
Those angels of death,
utterly unrivaled, with no
fear or mercy...{enter}
Their only intention was to
eradicate all life on this
planet.{enter}
Even Solaris' proudest
Gear battalions were
mere flies to them.{enter}
Nothing stopped them as
they indiscriminately
slaughtered and trampled
upon countless lives.{enter}
At that time, people were
certain that the end of the
world was approaching...{enter}
Dominated by feelings of
constant fear and
hopelessness, it was a
dreadful life...

#### 5 ####
The reason mankind was able
to make it through and
survive certain death,
500 years ago...{enter}
...was because the power
of these giants created
through god's wisdom.{enter}
Roni Fatima and the other
young fighters piloted
these giants and destroyed
the heart of Diabolos.{enter}
Seeing an opportunity to
counterattack, mankind
desperately stood up
against Diabolos...{enter}
...and successfully
annihilated them.{enter}
Roni Fatima, Queen Zephyr
and the rest of the young
ones put their lives on the
line and won back...{enter}
...the future for this
world.

#### 6 ####
Those giants which fought
long ago to save us. An
existence which surpasses
all other Gears.{enter}
They are the legendary
'Omnigears'.{enter}
One of them is the treasure
of the Aveh royal family...{enter}
...which is currently
resting somewhere within
the continent of Ignas.{enter}
But, I can't guarantee
that.

#### 7 ####
After the war and the
collapse of Diabolos,
similarly to the land
dwellers...{enter}
...the heavily beaten
Solaris forces began to
pull back and return to
their home country...{enter}
...taking along with them
vast numbers of land
dwellers as slaves.{enter}
We couldn't stop them.{enter}
The only way for the war
torned land dwellers to
survive was to depend on
Solaris...{enter}
After the brief moment of
hope, Solaris once again
began to reign over our
lives...{enter}
A cold and harsh era had
begun.{enter}
500 years have past and
their reign still
continues...{enter}
No one knows how long
this is going to last...

#### 8 ####
Surviving through the great
war of 500 years ago and
the Diabolos Collapse...{enter}
...we and the rest of the
our comrades secluded
ourselves on Shevat.{enter}
At the time, Shevat was
being constructed at the
tip of Babel Tower...{enter}
...but we were able to
escape to the sky before
Solaris once again ascended
to power over the land.{enter}
Since then, we've been
wandering the skies, while
overlooking the activities
of the land below.

#### 9 ####
You're probably already
aware of this...{enter}
...but this Shevat is
protected by a special
gate made possible by
an ancient technology.{enter}
Even Solaris cannot break
this barrier. Because of
that, we were able to avoid
being invaded to this day.{enter}
But even with that, we
don't have the power to
attack Solaris either...{enter}
It's a stalemate.
Basically, we've just been
glaring at each other.

#### 10 ####
After the war, Solaris
used a gate, like ours,
to separate itself from
the surface.{enter}
And then, they erased all
memory of their existence
from the surface dwellers.{enter}
Due to this, the surface
dwellers are still not
aware that they've been
secretly dominated by
Solaris all along.{enter}
To be born into a false
reality, to grow up in it,
and to die in it...without
ever approaching the truth.{enter}
...That is the life of a
surface dweller.
