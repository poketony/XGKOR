Is that waitress stupid? 
She said she has to go 
to block off the exit...

My big brother worked in
that restaurant.
He caught so many bilkers
who try to dine and dash.{enter}
He said he could tell who
would do that kinda thing.
Since he went into the army
there's a new waitress...{enter}
I want to make it easy for
him to get his job back
when he returns.{enter}
I mainly bug the waitress
and help the bilkers who
dine and dash get away.

My big brother came back
but he's not working at
the restaurant.{enter}
I'm doing my best to get
him a job soon. He says
he's gonna be a gardener.

Yep, home is best.
No enemy bullets or
sergeant's fists. And
best of all is my family.{enter}
The army taught me that
you have to do what you
want while you can.
