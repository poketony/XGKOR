"Wow...
So this is the 'Ethos'
workshop, heh, doc?"

#### 2 ####
Citan
"Yes. The 'Ethos' workshops
are the only places that
officially repair Gears.{enter}
Let us see if we can get
the parts we need to fix
{name:0B:¥ô¥§¥ë¥È©`¥ë} here.{enter}
As they say, time is money!
...So we should do whatever
we can do as soon as we are
able to."

Citan
"Sorry to bother you.{enter}
Our Gear has broken down,
so I would like to buy
some parts to fix it."

#### 4 ####
Citan
"Yes, we are hoping to
replace an X-29 model
injection bypass circuit."

#### 5 ####
Citan 
"I see.
Sorry to have
bothered you."

#### 6 ####
These days the 'Ethos'
technology has become
indispensable in people's
day-to-day lives.{enter}
We thought we'd use these 
left over facilites and 
try and help everyone as 
much as we can.

#### 7 ####
You two again?{enter}
As you can see, this facility
is for the repair of worker
Gears only.{enter}
We simply can't help you out
with the new model military
Gear that you have.

#### 8 ####
This town was orginally a
haven for treasure hunters
searching the ruins.{enter}
Our workshop can hardly keep
up with the demand for repairs
on the worker Gears used in
the excavation of the ruins.

#### 9 ####
Huh?
How can we help you?

#### 10 ####
Tough luck, huh?
Can you tell me what make
of parts you are after?

#### 11 ####
X-29 model injection
circuit?{enter}
That's only used on the
latest military models.
We don't keep those kind
of parts in stock here.{enter}
You can only get such
special parts by placing
an order at the 'Ethos'
headquarters.{enter}
This workshop is only
for the repair of
civilian Gears...

#### 12 ####
Sorry that we
can't help you.

#### 13 ####
Please don't touch it.
It's being repaired.
