Grahf
"I guess that's all
you can take for now.{wait:1E}
Are you frustrated?{enter}
But that is{wait:05}...{wait:05}
'only natural'.{wait:0A}
After all, you are
imperfect."

Fei
"Imperfect!?"

#### 4 ####
Grahf
"Yes.
You are lacking now.{enter}
The absence of wrath
is an impediment to
you utilizing your
true strength!"

#### 5 ####
Fei
"W, wrath...?"

#### 6 ####
Grahf
"The drive to massacre and
annihilate, the compulsion
to destroy your opponent...{enter}
Such wrath is power for the
soul! By eliminating your
foe, you attain your first
sublimation of that drive.{enter}
It is this very sublimation
that draws out the hidden
powers within oneself!{wait:14}
But,{wait:05} clinging to reason{wait:05}...{enter}
...{wait:05}suppressing your wrath
and desire, makes releasing
your true power a dream
within a dream for you.{enter}
You already know this...
When wrath appeared in
your heart, the machine
responded, did it not?{enter}
What drew out such power
from your machine was
truly the drive of your
soul{wait:05}...{wait:05} It was your 'Id'.{enter}
The sign of the purpose
you've been seeking{wait:05}...{wait:05}
The mark of a natural
born assassin!"

Fei
"You're wrong!{wait:14}
That's absolutely
untrue!"

#### 8 ####
Fei
"I, I am not 'Id'!
I..."

#### 9 ####
Grahf
"The time has come...{enter}
I'll take your soul,
and draw its power
out to the limit!"

#### 10 ####
Krelian
"Enough!"

#### 11 ####
Grahf
"Huh?
What are you
stopping me for!?"

#### 12 ####
Krelian
"He is bait.{enter}
If you kill the bait,
the precious bird we
wish to capture will
fly away.{enter}
You know{wait:05}...{wait:05}a very
important bird{wait:05}...{wait:05}
'needed to fulfill my
earnest desire'{wait:05}...{enter}
You understand, don't
you,{wait:0A} Lacan{wait:0A}...?"

#### 13 ####
Grahf
"...{wait:1E}
Suit yourself."

Krelian
"We shall crucify them.{enter}
In the land of Golgoda,
to the west of here.
Collect all the broken
Gears!"
