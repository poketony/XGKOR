battleship!"{clear:3C}

Margie
"Yeah, but look
what's coming
out of it...!"{clear:1E}

#### 3 ####
Shakhan
"Tomorrow is the 500th
anniversary of this
country.{enter}
Please come to the
dedication ceremony."

#### 4 ####
Shakhan
"There is a customary
Tournament after the
dedication ceremony..."

#### 5 ####
Ramsus
"What about the incident
in that report?"

#### 6 ####
Shakhan
"What? Oh, you mean the
500-year-old mobile weapon
excavated from the ruins?{enter}
Thanks to the help of the
'Ethos', the repairs are
complete.{enter}
I thought we could announce
it on the day of the
dedication ceremony..."

#### 7 ####
Ramsus
"Toys like that should
be given to Vanderkaum.{enter}
I'm talking about the
'Fatima Jasper'."

#### 8 ####
Shakhan
"I already have obtained
one half of the crest.{enter}
But I haven't been able
to get her to tell me
where the other half is.{enter}
She is a rather strong-
willed girl..."

#### 9 ####
Ramsus
"You're not being rough
with her, are you?"

#### 10 ####
Shakhan
"Of course not. I know
how you despise vulgar
acts like that."

#### 11 ####
Ramsus
"You said that girl is the
Holy Mother of Nisan...{wait:32}
Is she upstairs?"

#### 12 ####
Shakhan
"Yes, in the
east tower."

#### 13 ####
Ramsus
"Miang, could
it possibly be
a 'Relic'?"

#### 14 ####
Miang
"Yes. But there is still no
response. There seems to be
a barrier or something.{enter}
However, we do know from
the 500-year-old records
that one certainly exists
in this vicinity.{enter}
It's probably well
preserved too."

#### 15 ####
Ramsus
"...Let's meet her.{enter}
I want to talk to her
directly. Miang, you
come with me."

#### 16 ####
Miang
"Yes sir."

#### 17 ####
Fei
"That's..."

#### 18 ####
Bart
"Are you guys
in the mood for
another battle?"{clear:3C}

#### 19 ####
Margie
"Bart, we better
get outta here...
and fast!"{clear:3C}

#### 20 ####
Fei
"Quick...{wait:14}run!{clear:1E}

#### 21 ####
Ramsus
"I can't believe you
were beaten by such
a small force...{enter}
I have only just
taken over my post
and already you have
embarrassed me!"

#### 22 ####
Vanderkaum
"I am sorry Commander.
They were more persistent
than we anticipated.{enter}
They had a new model Gear
that was very mobile.
I couldn't get a lock on
it with the main gun...{enter}
Otherwise there would have
been no way we could have
been beaten by such..."

#### 23 ####
Ramsus
"Fool!
Know when to use that
big gun, and on whom!{enter}
You failed because you
try to solve everything
with force.{enter}
You have muscles instead
of brains."

#### 24 ####
Vanderkaum
"Commander!!"

#### 25 ####
Ramsus
"Dismissed.
Go polish your beloved
1200 sem cannon."

#### 26 ####
Shakhan
"Well, well, Commander.{enter}
You've only just taken
command and already you
are achieving splendid
results.{enter}
You dispatched those
irksome Kislev units
in a matter of days...
I'm very impressed."
