Billy
...{wait:0A}...{wait:0A} I...{wait:0A}...{wait:0A}
still can't believe it.{enter}
The 'Ethos' was that
dubious an organization{wait:0A}...{wait:0A}
What was it that I believed
in...{wait:0A} all this time?"

Billy
"V...{wait:0A} Verlaine!?"

Billy
"Father!{wait:0A}
How could you do that!?"

#### 7 ####
Billy
"That symbol...!"

#### 8 ####
Billy
"You claim Verlaine and his
men are an assassination
unit for the Bishop!?{enter}
How could you even say
such blasphemy!?"

#### 9 ####
Billy
"Is that true, Verlaine?{wait:19}
But why people from
the 'Ethos'?"

#### 10 ####
Billy
"Even if that were true,
we have no right to punish
others!{enter}
Judgement belongs to god.{wait:14}
That is what we were
taught, wasn't it!?"

#### 11 ####
Billy
"I...{wait:0F}I have been
passing judgement?"

#### 12 ####
Billy
"Verlaine!{wait:0F}
Hang in there!"

#### 13 ####
Billy
"Verlaine!{wait:0A}
Verlaine!"

What in heavens are you
trying to accomplish!?"

Jessie
"What are you getting
flustered about,{wait:0F} boy?{enter}
It was a stun bullet.{wait:0A}
He's just taking a nap.{wait:0A}
You should've been able to
tell by the sound it made!{enter}
Besides,{wait:0A} these murderers
are not from {wait:0A}the 'Ethos'!"

#### 21 ####
Jessie
"Look!"

#### 22 ####
Jessie
"Yes, that's right.{wait:0F}
They're agents of Solaris!{enter}
Probably an assassination
unit under Stone's command!{enter}
I got word that they were
exterminating all 'Ethos'
members, and hurried here.{wait:0A}
But I was too late...{enter}
All 'Ethos' affiliates
have already been killed,
except for those on some
sort of salvage mission."

#### 23 ####
Jessie
"I won't let you go
that easily, Stein!!"

#### 24 ####
Jessie
"Stein, you aren't
goin' anywhere!!"

#### 25 ####
Are you trying to take away my
ultimate pleasure,{wait:0F} Verlaine?

#### 26 ####
Verlaine
"Gha-ha!!"

#### 27 ####
Verlaine
"Ugh!"

#### 28 ####
Stone
"A good-for-nothing
chatterbox such as you
has no right to live."

#### 29 ####
Stone
"I am the inquisitor sent
to Earth from Solaris."

#### 30 ####
Stone
"The status of bishop
is merely a convenience
for my activities on Earth.{enter}
The 'Ethos' was created as
a Solaris sub-organization
and given the task of
managing earth-dwellers.{enter}
But over the years the
'Ethos' started to set
up convenient doctrines
for itself...{enter}
It then went on to gather
the ignorant masses, and
created a god for them to
believe in.{enter}
Then, the 'Ethos' even
went so far as to plot
a separation from its
creator, Solaris.{enter}
So Solaris had no choice
but to eliminate all those
who defy our rule and raise
the flag of rebellion.{enter}
The ones prepared as
'eliminators' were{wait:05}...{wait:0A}
the Etone.{enter}
Etones, 'the Atoners',{wait:05} the
organization I established
within  the 'Ethos',{wait:05} had
two purposes{wait:05}...{enter}
On the surface their aim
was to eliminate the{wait:05}
'Reapers'{wait:05} or {wait:05}-Wels-{wait:05} that
run rampant on the earth.{enter}
But,{wait:0A} that's not their only
purpose.{wait:14} Behind the scenes,
we also had selected men
like Verlaine{wait:05}...{enter}
These were responsible for
observing{wait:0A} and eliminating{wait:0A}
any corrupt people who
appeared in the 'Ethos'.{enter}
You didn't have the chance
to learn of this, since you
left the 'Ethos' so early.{enter}
{wait:05}...{wait:0A}Or actually,{wait:05}
I just never told you.{wait:14}
There was 'another role'
I wanted you to perform!"

#### 31 ####
Billy
"Another{wait:0A}...{wait:0A}{fast:FF}role!?"

#### 32 ####
Stone
"Billy.{wait:14} There are certain
things in this world that
you're happier not knowing.{enter}
Even lies and deceptions
can become the truth for
some people of the earth.{enter}
...{wait:05}Particularly those not
knowing the true nature
of things, or how these
systems of things works.{enter}
In fact, the {wait:05}-god-{wait:05} and
{wait:05}-faith-{wait:05} systems set up by
the 'Ethos' were the truth
itself,{wait:05} were they not?"

#### 33 ####
Billy
"Tell me!{wait:0F}
What other 'role' were
you talking about?{enter}
What did Verlaine
mean when he spoke
of{wait:0F} 'judgement'!?"

#### 34 ####
Stone
"So you want to know?{enter2}
But can you bear the full
weight of the truth?{enter}
Billy, if you can bear
that weight, then I'm
willing to tell you."

#### 35 ####
Billy
"{wait:0A}...{wait:0A}"

#### 36 ####
Stone
"You believed that you
were saving wandering
souls, didn't you...?{enter}
That's why you carried
out your cleansing of
the 'Reapers' -Wels-
from the earth, right?{enter}
In fact it was all just
another control system
put in place by Solaris.{enter}
But what's more, your
'saving' work...{wait:0A}that very
activity you believed in so
much,{wait:0A} was{wait:05} in{wait:05} reality{wait:0A}..."

#### 37 ####
Jessie
"You're talking too
much nonsense!"

#### 38 ####
Jessie
"You haven't changed
at all since then...{enter2}
have you, Stein!?"

#### 39 ####
Billy
"Stein?"

#### 40 ####
Stone
"That's a name I haven't
been called for a long
time{wait:05}...{enter}
Hearing that name vividly
brings back a pleasant
twinge of pain to the
'scars on this body'.{enter}
You know what I mean,
Jesiah?"

#### 41 ####
Jessie
"Heh, your brain still
isn't working right.{enter}
{fast:FF}Answer me!{wait:19}
{fast:00}Why do you have such
'a roundabout way
of doing things'!?"

#### 42 ####
Stone
"That's not worth
wasting my breath
answering...{enter}
Just consider it
'my reward in life'...{enter}
Of course, that includes
watching your agonizing
death.{enter}
I could succumb to the 
desire to slice up your 
body here and now, and
drag out your innards...{enter}
But I can't do that now,
I have a matter to attend
to elsewhere.{enter}
That 'duty' comes before
any pleasure I could have
with you here. I haven't
the time to waste anymore!"

#### 43 ####
Stone
"I can't be bothered by
insignificant wretches
like you."

#### 44 ####
Stone
"Until next time! And, as
a parting gift, I'll have
these men entertain you!"

#### 45 ####
Stone
"Well then, excuse me.{enter}
Oh and Billy! If you have
something you wish to
discuss, come see me later.
I'll be waiting for you."

#### 46 ####
Isn't that the very reason
why I told you back then...{wait:14}
that you belong with us{wait:05}...?

#### 47 ####
Verlaine
"You're defiled, {wait:0A}Billy.{enter}
You left the 'Ethos' and
kept company with dregs
who have no faith at all.
And you lost sight of what
it means to be defiled.{enter}
I didn't expect it out of
you... You who used to
live only for your faith.{wait:1E}
You should have remained
like us.{enter}
But fear not, Billy.{wait:14}
I shall cleanse you.{wait:14}
You'll live within me.{wait:14}
You will become one with
me in death{wait:0A}...{wait:0A}

#### 48 ####
Verlaine
"What!?"

#### 49 ####
Verlaine
"That's right{wait:05}...{wait:05}
We are servants
of the Bishop.{enter}
Our mission is to hand out
judgement on fallen priests
and sinners in order to
make them repent."

#### 50 ####
Verlaine
"The pontiff and his
brethren deserve to die!{enter}
They allowed greed to tempt
them into abandoning their
'duties as the 'Ethos'' to
pursue world domination.{enter}
They passed their own death
sentences when they allowed
such desires to overtake
them.{enter}
And that's not all.{enter}
Saving orphans and
refugees{wait:05}...{wait:05}
that may seem like
works of mercy.{enter}
But the little boys and
girls kept here were
actually used as a means
to satisfy the desires of
the pontiff and bishops.{enter}
Indulging in selfish
desires...{wait:14}
This is not 'conduct
befitting priests'!{enter}
Such defiled leaven have
no right to speak for god.
That is why we set out on
this purification work.{enter}
They must atone for
their sins.{wait:14}
These are the
Bishop's orders!"

#### 51 ####
Verlaine
"God?{wait:14}
Where does such
a being exist?{enter}
You should know by now how
the 'Ethos' came about...{enter}
It was an organization
created by Solaris aeons
ago solely for the purpose
of managing ignorant humans.{enter}
Its doctrines are just
deceptions designed to
control the masses.{enter}
The 'Ethos' used the two
sweet fruits of 'faith'
and 'technology' well to
skillfully manipulate global
affairs and people's zeal.{enter}
Thus, they manipulated the
ignorant masses to
repeatedly continue their
pointless wars.{enter}
Eventually, battle data on
'man' and 'weapons' gleaned
from these wars, were sent
to Solaris itself...{enter}
And analyzed to aid in 
ruling the entire Earth.{enter}
These intentionally
perpetuated wars caused
much phychological discord.{enter}
But faith in 'god'...{wait:14}
salvation...
was used as a cushion
to soften the blow.{enter}
It was a well thought-
out system.{wait:14}
But the choice of managers
was extremely poor.{enter}
Or did you think that acting
the part of a faithful
servant of god would
someday yield an answer
from a great god somewhere?{enter}
Can't you see that such
a divine being just 'never
existed from the beginning'?{enter}
And you don't seem to
realize this, but you
yourself were 'passing
judgement on sinners'
as much as we were!"

#### 52 ####
Verlaine
"That's right.{wait:14}
Daily you have been
dirtying your hands
as an accomplice{wait:05}..."

#### 53 ####
Verlaine
"Bi{wait:14}...{wait:05}lly{wait:14}...{wait:0A}..."
