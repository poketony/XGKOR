The remote village of Lahan,
 in the outskirts of Aveh,
near the border with Kislev.{clear:A0}

#### 2 ####
This is where it all begins.{clear:96}

#### 3 ####
The continent of Ignas, in the
northern hemisphere of our world.{wait:1E}
On this, the largest continent,
a war has been raging between two
countries for hundreds of years.{wait:1E}
In the north of the continent lies
the Kislev Empire, in the south
lies the desert kingdom of Aveh.{wait:1E}
The war has gone on for so long
that the people have forgotten the
cause, knowing only the pointless
circle of hostility and tragedy.{wait:C8}{wait:C8}{wait:C8}

#### 4 ####
The chronic war obsession was soon
to encounter a devastating change.{wait:1E}
This was due to the 'Ethos',{wait:0A} an
institution that preserves our
world's culture,{wait:0A} repairing tools
and weapons excavated from the
ruins of an ancient civilization.{wait:1E}
At once both countries excavated
these ruins, and had the 'Ethos'
repair the discoveries, in order
to increase their military power.{wait:C8}{wait:DC}{wait:DC}

#### 5 ####
The various weapons excavated from
the ruins greatly changed the form
of warfare.{wait:1E}
The outcome of the battles between
the two countries was no longer
determined by man-to-man combat,
but by 'Gears'{wait:0A} - giant humanoid
fighting machines -{wait:0A} that were
obtained from deep within the
ruins.{wait:C8}{wait:C8}{wait:C8}

#### 6 ####
Eventually,{wait:0A} after continuous
swings in the state of the war,{wait:0A}
Kislev gained the upper hand.{wait:1E}
The major factor behind this lay
in the enormous difference in the
amount of resources buried within
their ruins.{wait:1E}
But suddenly a mysterious military
force appeared in the continent of
Ignas.{wait:14} Called 'Gebler', this force
decided to make contact with Aveh.{wait:C8}{wait:C8}{wait:C8}

#### 7 ####
With the assistance of this Gebler
military force,{wait:05} Aveh was able to
recover from being hopelessly out-
numbered to being back on an even
standing with Kislev.{wait:1E}
Then,{wait:0A} taking further advantage of
its newly gained momentum,{wait:0A} Aveh
started to capture one territory
after another from Kislev,{wait:0A} showing
no indication of slowing down in
their invasion campaign.{wait:C8}{wait:DC}{wait:DC}
