Elly
"Where am I...?"

#### 2 ####
Elly
"K, Krelian...Commander?"

#### 3 ####
Elly
"Please, stop!"

#### 4 ####
Elly
"...?"

#### 5 ####
Elly
"My other self...?"

#### 6 ####
Elly
"Where's Fei? Where is
everyone...?"

#### 7 ####
Elly
"You're planning on sending
them to the same fate as...{enter}
...those people in that
research facility!{enter}
Doing all this for your
own selfish ambitions...{wait:1E}
Do you know what you're
doing!?{enter}
People playing with other
people's lives. That's
deplorable!"

#### 8 ####
Elly
"What do you think of
accomplishing by using that
molecular machine?{enter}
What connection do I have
with it?"

#### 9 ####
Elly
"Mother...?"

#### 10 ####
Elly
"..."

#### 11 ####
Elly
"Commander!?"

#### 12 ####
Elly
"What're you!?"

#### 13 ####
Elly
"What?"

#### 14 ####
Elly
"Th, that hurts!
P, please!
Please stop!"

#### 15 ####
Elly
"Who're you referring to
when you say that man...{wait:1E}
Are you talking about Fei?"

#### 16 ####
Elly
"R, Ramsus...{wait:14}that drug...{wait:1E}
A mental stabilizer...?{enter}
Why are you so shook up
like that? What's forcing
you to go through all this?{enter}
What happened between you
and Fei..."

#### 17 ####
Elly
"Ramsus..."

#### 18 ####
Krelian
"I've looked into your
records."

#### 19 ####
Krelian
"Elhaym Van Houten.
That incident at the Jugend
one year ago...{enter}
Case 102. The release of
your latent powers from
that systematic...{enter}
...administration of mental
enhancment drugs.{enter}
In that instant, your Ether
value had increased beyond
400.{enter}
And in that moment, 2
were critically wounded
and 3 required recycling.{enter}
Am I right?"

#### 20 ####
Krelian
"But, this record is wrong.{enter}
This wasn't the usual
uncontrollable mental
side effects."

#### 21 ####
Krelian
"This was caused by the
'awakening of your other
inner self'."

#### 22 ####
Krelian
"They will be used as an
offering for the...{enter}
...resurrection of the
Gazel Ministry.{enter}
The same fate awaits that
girl, the artificial
organism.{enter}
I've already taken enough
samples from her.{enter}
I'm already well into the
fourth stage of my plan.
All I need now is the
final factor.{enter}
Hence, your friends are
no longer of any use to
me.{wait:1E} They're worthless.{enter}
But, you are different."

#### 23 ####
Krelian
"I see...{wait:1E}
So you've seen the
research facility.{enter}
Presently, the Solaris
researchers are working
on genetic engineering
down there.{enter}
It's just a nest for fools
who've learned the
despicable pleasure of...{enter}
...playing with their own
organic creations. They
seek only serendipity and
inhumanity.{enter}
That is not my place.
I specialize in
molecular engineering...
Nanotechnology."

#### 24 ####
Krelian
"Do you know what this is?
A nanomachine...a molecular
machine.{enter}
This is the assembler,
which is one of those
nanomachine machines.{enter}
It can break down molecules
and atoms and reconstruct
it into anything.{enter}
Each of these spheres are
equivalent to an atom.{enter}
Until recently, we were
only able to produce...{enter}
...materials which were
several times the
size of this.{enter}
Thanks to that girl, the
one we obtained from the
ruins of the Zeboim
civilization,{enter}
we are now able to make it
this compact and elaborate.{enter}
To think that such a
mechanism was created 4000
years ago. It's quite
astonishing.{enter}
Up until we discovered
this, the work was rather
crude.{enter}
The best we could possibly
do until now was to apply
amino acid solutions to
wounded areas for...{enter}
...amelioration or to seal
up any peculiar abilities.{enter}
I'm sure you've had some
exposure to genetics when
you were in the Jugend.{enter}
Each type of those enzymes
inside the DNA...are also
molecular machines that
were created by nature.{enter}
That is, if we are indeed
the progeny of the very
first organism."

#### 25 ####
Krelian
"Although the nanomachines
up until now could
recombine DNA...{enter}
...they couldn't uncover
any information in the
intron which are located
in the replacements...{enter}
...of the double helix.
However, the newer
nanomachines easily
discovered this data.{enter}
Data that originally
'should not have existed'.
And we are about to see the
results of that."

#### 26 ####
Krelian
"Hmm, according to the
tranferred record, it
depicts...{enter}
...a similar wave
frequency as expected."

#### 27 ####
Krelian
"And...yes, the Urobolus
Ring...!{enter}
That is it, isn't it...?{enter}
Miang, and Lacan's
actions...{wait:28}
This explains everything."

#### 28 ####
Krelian
"Elhaym...
You were the 'mother'..."

#### 29 ####
Krelian
"Yes.{enter}
This is what your genetic
exon looked like before
replacement...{enter}
This is the conceptualized
form of the intron which
carries information that
isn't supposed to exist.{enter}
Observe. This is the
Urobulos Ring which
contains 'intron
information' which only...{enter}
...exists in 'certain
people'. Urobolus...if
we were to anatomize such
a thing...{enter}
Wouldn't you be interested
in what type of information
it would have to offer us?"

#### 30 ####
Krelian
"Elhaym, you are beautiful.{enter}
When I look at you, I
appreciate the artistic
aspect of the human form,
its elaborateness...{enter}
I can't help but feel the
importance of that.{enter}
As if my molecular machine
is unworthy of you.{enter}
You haven't changed
'since then'.{enter}
Just like the 'other one',
Lacan..."

#### 31 ####
Ramsus
"Wh...re...?"

#### 32 ####
Ramsus
"Where...?
I'm asking you
where!!"

#### 33 ####
Ramsus
"Where is he!?
Where!?{enter}
I know you know!
Take me to him!"

#### 34 ####
Ramsus
"Fei, Fei, Fei...{enter}
Fei this...Fei that..."

#### 35 ####
Ramsus
"Fei...!{wait:14}
In what way is he more
superior than I!?{enter}
I will not accept it.
I will not!!"

#### 36 ####
Ramsus
"Errrrg..."

#### 37 ####
Ramsus
"Dammit Fei...{wait:1E}
I'll show you...{wait:1E}
I..."
