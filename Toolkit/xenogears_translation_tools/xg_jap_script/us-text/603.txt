#### 1 ####
Where am I...!?

#### 2 ####
That's Elly!
This must mean that
I am inside of Deus!?

#### 3 ####
Not exactly.{enter}
Your actual body is but a
physical object...{wait:05} It has
merely been absorbed into
Deus' outer-shell.{wait:05}
Only your consciousness is
here.{enter}
Of course, the girl you
perceive in front of you is
also not a true being.{wait:05}
Your consciousness is merely
creating her image.

#### 4 ####
!?

#### 5 ####
The 'Wave Existence'...?{wait:05}
No...{wait:05}that's not you...!!{wait:05}
Who are you...?

#### 6 ####
It can't be...!?{wait:05}
Is that you Krelian!?{wait:05}
That's right, isn't it...!?{wait:0A}
Krelian!{wait:0A} It was you who did 
this to Elly!

#### 7 ####
The 'Path of Sephirot' has
been connected.{wait:05}
No one can stop god from
returning to his world now.{enter}
So what have you come here
for, Lacan?

#### 8 ####
I came here to take the
person I love back with me!{wait:05}
So set Elly free!{enter}
The Deus' system has been
destroyed.
It's all over now!{enter}
So instead I ask you...{wait:0A}
What are you hoping to
achieve now!?

#### 9 ####
The time when all things
started...
The place where all things
were one...
I am going to return there!

#### 10 ####
What place?

#### 11 ####
Before the beginning of the
universe,{wait:05} in the undulating
waves of the higher dimension,{wait:05}
all things were one.{enter}
It was the waves spilling out
from there that created this
four-dimensional universe of
ours.{enter}
'Humankind'{wait:05} and the 'Souls of
Humankind' that were born from
there,{wait:05} are merely leftovers of
those spilled waves.{wait:0A}
So...

#### 12 ####
You're going back there?
Is that what you desired?

#### 13 ####
Lacan...{wait:05}
Why such reluctance to
become one with the god?{wait:05}
What attachment could you
possibly have to this
wretched old world?{enter}
What meaning can be found
in living out such a short
existence...{wait:05}hurting others,{wait:05}
hurting yourself,{wait:05} grinding
one another down...{wait:05}only to
inevitably die and return
to dust?{enter}
Why, everything we could
ever desire is here...{wait:05}
No need to be troubled by
the need for love...{wait:05}
For this place is filled
with the love of god.

#### 14 ####
I have not lost hope in
humans as much as you have,
Krelian...{enter}
Someday humankind will come
to understand one another!
I sincerely believe that!

#### 15 ####
How can you be so sure?{wait:05}
Humans will never come to
understand each other.{enter}
You said that she is the
person you love.{wait:05}
But can you say that you
even truly understand
each other?{enter}
All humans do is place
themselves at a comfortable
distance from each other
and call that {wait:05}'mutual under-
standing',{wait:05} 'spiritual unity',{wait:05}
or{wait:05} 'true love'{wait:05}...{wait:05}
but it is all lies!{enter}
Man cannot associate with
others without first
deceiving themselves.{wait:05}
That is the way that they
were created.

#### 16 ####
But one being's ego can't
determine everyone's fate!{enter}
People have the right to
choose their own destiny!{wait:05}
That is why humans have
free will!

#### 17 ####
And what if that 'will'
itself was predetermined?{wait:05}
What then?{enter}
Oh, what folly!?!{wait:05}
Humans are just primitive
life forms that have no
such things as free will...{enter}
Mankind has merely been
allowed to live in an
imperfect state...{wait:05}
"as is",{wait:05} "as will be"{wait:05}...{enter}
It is for this very reason...{wait:05}
because humans have this
wretched 'will' or whatnot...{wait:05}
that humans must experience
sadness and loss.{enter}
For someone to gain something
means another must lose it...{wait:05}
It is impossible to make
humankind share limited
"things" and "affections"...{enter}
So I came to the conclusion
that everything must be
reverted back to where it
all began.{enter}
To go back to when all was
one...{wait:05}
waves, and nothing else...{wait:05}
It is not my -Human's- ego...{wait:05}
It is the will of the 'Waves'{wait:05}
...the will of {wait:05}-god-{wait:05}...

#### 18 ####
Well that's alright, too...{wait:05}
We don't have to be perfect.{enter}
Actually, being imperfect
makes mankind live by
helping each other...{wait:05}
That's what being human is...{enter}
That's mutual understanding!{wait:05}
That's 'unity' and 'love'...{wait:05}
I'm glad...{wait:05}no,{wait:05} I'm proud...{wait:05}
to be human!

#### 19 ####
Elly placed the future,{wait:05}
-tomorrow-,{wait:05} in our hands,
based on our choice...{wait:0A}
And she is working to keep
Deus far from our planet.{enter}
She is also trying to heal
your heart...{wait:0A}
you,{wait:05} who wants to journey,{wait:05}
all alone,{wait:05} to be with god...{enter}
Can't you understand Elly's
feelings!?{wait:0A}
Do you have to become one
with god before you are able
to comprehend all of this?{enter}
I understand...{wait:05}
I know her feelings...{wait:05}
as if they were my own...{enter}
Yes...{wait:05}she and I are one!{wait:0A}
We don't need god's help!!

#### 20 ####
Well then, prove it to me...{wait:0A}
Show me this power of humans!{wait:0A}
Show me this -love-,
that you say can make you
independent of god...

#### 21 ####
Fei
"Elly..."

#### 22 ####
Elly
"Fei{wait:0A}...{enter}
It was Krelian...{wait:0A}
Krelian released me..."

#### 23 ####
Fei
"Krelian...?"

#### 24 ####
Elly
"Yes. I came to understand
after becoming one with
Krelian...{enter}
His heart was so full of
sadness.{wait:05} That is why he
desired for he and I to
become one with god...{enter}
Because that would be the
return to the beginning of
everything...{wait:14}
He told me...{enter}
"You should be with him..."{wait:0A}
That is what he said...{wait:05}
You see...{wait:05}
He already knew!{enter}
Yes, he already knew...{wait:0A}
how I felt,{wait:05} how you felt...{wait:0A}
But there was nothing we
or he could do...{enter}
He had no choice but to go
forward...{wait:05} even if it meant
he lost all feelings,{wait:05} lost
everything that was human!{enter}
For all humankind's sake...{wait:05}
There was no going back...{wait:05}
Even looking back held too
many memories...{enter}
And he would have{wait:05}...{wait:0A}
just wanted to go back{wait:05}...{wait:0A}
Even though he couldn't{wait:05}...{enter}
So please forgive him...{wait:0A}
Krelian loved people more
than anyone else..."

#### 25 ####
Fei
"I{wait:05}...{wait:0A} 
I, somehow{wait:05}...{wait:0A}
knew it all along...{enter}
I just knew he was really
that kind of person..."

#### 26 ####
Elly
"{wait:05}...{wait:0A}I am so sorry{wait:05}...{wait:0A}
Please forgive me!{wait:05}
I was wrong...{enter}
I thought sacrificing
myself in order to save
others was the right
thing to do...{enter}
But my actions only brought
sadness to all the people
who I left behind.{enter}
And that sadness gave birth
to even more sadness.{enter}
As long as 'I' still live
within you, my life is not
just mine alone."

#### 27 ####
Fei
"Elly...
That isn't wrong.{enter}
To sacrifice yourself for
others is a noble thing...{wait:0A}
Even if it were to benefit
yourself, it's no problem.{enter}
There will always be a
person healed...{wait:0A}
One or the other...{enter}
Love gains its original
shine only when there's an
interrelationship between
the giver and the receiver.{enter}
It is incomplete when one
or the other is missing...{wait:0A}
The two are one.{enter}
It was you, Elly, who
taught me that.{wait:14}
I believe that is what it
means to be human...{enter}
I can now understand the
true importance of it.{wait:0A}
I don't know if it's the
right answer or not...{enter}
But we have a lot of time
to think about it...{enter}
What Krelian himself was
looking for all along...{wait:0A}
We will find the answer to
it all...ourselves..."

#### 28 ####
Elly
"Thank you...
Fei!"

#### 29 ####
Fei
"Elly..."
