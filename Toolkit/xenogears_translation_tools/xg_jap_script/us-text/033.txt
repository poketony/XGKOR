Fei
"This is...{wait:0A}
Dazil..."

#### 2 ####
Fei
"Repair {name:0B:¥ô¥§¥ë¥È©`¥ë}..."

#### 3 ####
Fei
"Yeah, okay doc,{wait:0F}
let's check this
place out then."

#### 4 ####
Fei
"...{wait:0A}
Doc, do you have a moment?
I need to talk to you."

#### 5 ####
Fei
"...{wait:0A}
Well doc, it's about
{name:0B:¥ô¥§¥ë¥È©`¥ë}...{enter}
We can't find the parts
we need, so is it alright
if we just don't fix it?"

#### 6 ####
Fei
"Well, we've been able to
come as far as Dazil on
our own...{enter}
So doesn't that show that
we don't need {name:0B:¥ô¥§¥ë¥È©`¥ë}
as much as we thought.{enter}
Actually, I've been
thinking that once things
cool down I want to go back
to Lahan and help rebuild.{enter}
That's all I feel I can
do now{wait:0A}..."

#### 7 ####
Fei
"Move it away?
But why do we need
to do that, doc?"

#### 8 ####
Fei
"Special Force{wait:0A}...{wait:0A}
You mean Elly's group?"

#### 9 ####
Fei
"New technology?"

#### 10 ####
Fei
"Hold on, doc!{wait:0F}
Won't the Kislev army
still be in Lahan too!"

#### 11 ####
Fei
"The armies will fight over
who gets {name:0B:¥ô¥§¥ë¥È©`¥ë}...{wait:0A}
And right near Lahan too."

#### 12 ####
Fei
"But, we can't fix it
in order to move it..."

#### 13 ####
Fei
"What do you intend
on doing, doc?"

#### 14 ####
Fei
"So then doc, what do
you plan on doing with
this sand buggy?"

#### 15 ####
Fei
"Sand buggy?"

#### 16 ####
Fei
"The 'Ethos'? {wait:0A}
What do Gears have to
do with the 'Ethos'?"

#### 17 ####
Fei 
"Huh?"

#### 18 ####
Citan
"Yes, that is right.{wait:0F} 
The desert town of Dazil."

#### 19 ####
Citan
"We should be able to find
out what both Aveh and
Kislev are up to, here.{enter}
And we also have to gather
the things we need to
repair {name:0B:¥ô¥§¥ë¥È©`¥ë}."

#### 20 ####
Citan
"Yes. We must exchange
the broken parts to fix
{name:0B:¥ô¥§¥ë¥È©`¥ë}...{enter}
Otherwise it will not be
able to function at all!{enter}
There is an 'Ethos'
workshop in the southern
part of this town.{wait:0A}
Let us go there, Fei."

#### 21 ####
Citan
"Only the 'Ethos' has the
technology to maintain
generator driven Gear.{enter}
The 'Ethos' decides which
Gear gets which generator
in which country..."

#### 22 ####
Citan
"Yes,{wait:05} of course,{wait:05} Fei..."

#### 23 ####
Citan
"So Fei, what did you want
to talk to me about?"

#### 24 ####
Citan
"Do not repair it?
What is the problem, Fei?"

#### 25 ####
Citan
"...{wait:0A}I see.
If that is what you want,
Fei, then fine.{enter}
But I think we should
try and move {name:0B:¥ô¥§¥ë¥È©`¥ë}
as far away from there
as possible."

#### 26 ####
Citan
"It is only my
speculation, but...{enter}
I suspect the incident that
evening occured because the
Gebler Special Force stole
a Kislev Military Gear."

#### 27 ####
Citan
"Exactly.{enter}
When I examined the broken
Gear in the village, I
realized the Gebler pilot
was riding a Kislev Gear.{enter}
It must have had some new
technology involved in it
for the Kislev army to send
pursuit forces after it."

#### 28 ####
Citan
"I suspect that the Gebler
Force was out to steal a
new experimental Gear."

#### 29 ####
Citan
"I am sure news of the
Special Force's failure
has reached the capital.{enter}
They will be investigating
the Lahan area to reclaim
whatever parts of the new
Gear that they can find."

#### 30 ####
Citan
"Most probably.{enter}
And in that case, there
will be a conflict between
Aveh's inspection team and
Kislev's pursuit troops.{enter}
If they find where we have
hidden {name:0B:¥ô¥§¥ë¥È©`¥ë}..."

#### 31 ####
Citan
"So, to avoid any problems,
we should move {name:0B:¥ô¥§¥ë¥È©`¥ë}
somewhere else right away!"

#### 32 ####
Citan
"Right.
But staying here will
solve nothing.{enter}
Fortunately, this is the
center of all excavation
work in this country.{enter}
There is bound to be some
information on where we
can find parts...{enter}
Anyway, the fear is often
worse than the danger
itself... We should not let
such fears hold us back!"

#### 33 ####
Citan
"This a sand buggy.{enter}
{wait:0A}...{wait:0A}
That is it, Fei!{enter}
I have thought of a good
way to get the parts we
need for {name:0B:¥ô¥§¥ë¥È©`¥ë}.{enter}
Let us go back to the
rental shop and rent out
this buggy."

#### 34 ####
Citan
"This is a sand buggy.{enter}
{wait:0A}...{wait:0A}
That is it Fei!{enter}
I have thought of a good
way to get the parts we 
need for {name:0B:¥ô¥§¥ë¥È©`¥ë}.{enter}
First, we have got to
find out who will rent
us this buggy."

#### 35 ####
Citan
"A sand buggy is a special
car made for the desert.{enter}
Its tires do not sink into
the sand, so it is a must
for long trips into the
desert."

#### 36 ####
Citan
"Well, leave it to me.
Just you wait and see."

#### 37 ####
With that truce with
Kislev, the war is
basically over.{enter}
Now our job will be to
protect the people
from desert pirates.

#### 38 ####
Three weeks ago Kislev
raided the ruins to the
north. They're probably
coming here next.{enter}
Be careful if you go 
digging at the ruins.

#### 39 ####
Hey, I haven't seen you
round here before.{enter}
Don't think that if you
cause trouble you'll get
away with it!{enter}
We're Aveh Army Guards!
...Remember that!

#### 40 ####
Feels like the war's over.
Now thing's should get
better. I'm so relieved.

#### 41 ####
This is the Aveh Guard
station.{enter}
This town is important
because it's the base for
excavating the ruins. {enter}
The elite of our army 
are stationed here.

#### 42 ####
Hey, I haven't seen you
round here before.{enter}
Don't think that if you
cause trouble you'll get
away with it!{enter}
We're Aveh Army Guards!
...Remember that!

#### 43 ####
All's clear!

#### 44 ####
No enemies sighted!

#### 45 ####
Peace...
The war's not over yet
though.{enter}
Still, it's like heaven
compared to when we were
always expecting enemy
attacks.

#### 46 ####
There's a story floating
around that the Kislev army
is looking for buried Gear.{enter}
Be careful if you go
digging in the ruins.

#### 47 ####
Hey, I haven't seen you
round here before.{enter}
Don't think that if you
cause trouble you'll get
away with it!{enter}
We're Aveh Army Guards!
...Remember that!

#### 48 ####
Someone named Sigurd is
in charge until the
change to a republic.{enter}
...Do you think a
republic is a good
idea?{enter}
Anyway, I'm just glad
that an end to the war
is in sight.

#### 49 ####
The battle with Kislev the
other day in the desert ended
in a complete victory for us.{enter}
We need the army because they
get us generators from the
Gears found in the ruins.{enter}
We'll never give this town
or our ruins to Kislev.

#### 50 ####
Hey, I haven't seen you
'round here before.{enter}
Don't think that if you
cause trouble you'll get
away with it!{enter}
We're Aveh Army Guards!
...Remember that!

#### 51 ####
There are burglars out
looking for treasure
in the desert ruins!{enter}
{wait:05}...{wait:05}Brrr{wait:05}...{wait:05}
{wait:05}...{wait:05}Shivers{wait:05}...!{wait:05}
Oh,{wait:05} I just wet my pants.{enter}
You better be careful too.

#### 52 ####
There's a lotta people
who get lost in the desert
and die of starvation!{enter}
{wait:05}...{wait:05}Brrr{wait:05}...{wait:05}
{wait:05}...{wait:05}Shivers{wait:05}...!{wait:05}
Oh,{wait:05} I just pooed my pants.{enter}
You better be careful too.

#### 53 ####
Gee, I wanna
climb up there...

#### 54 ####
 Welcome! 

#### 55 ####
I counted on the war so I
bought a lot of stuff...{enter}
So what happens to my money
when we become a republic?
I'm gonna get wiped out!

#### 56 ####
Lately there's rumors of
all out war with Kislev.{enter}
I'm gonna stock up while
there're still just small
border skirmishes.

#### 57 ####
Hmm, the prices are a
little high.{enter}
But we need these things
to cross the desert...

#### 58 ####
Shakhan who had been
ruling this country
has been chased out!{enter}
The war with Kislev might
end, and life will be easy
again. I'm so happy.

#### 59 ####
Since those Gebler forces
came, Aveh's hardly ever
lost to Kislev.{enter}
I wish the 'Ethos' would
give out some of those
new powerful Gears.

#### 60 ####
Hmm, you look tired.
You can stay overnight at
the bar, so why don't you
rest there a little bit?{enter}
Travelling all worn and
tired, might just get you
killed.

#### 61 ####
Hey, why the long face?
Something bad happen?{enter}
It's times like this,
you need a drink...{enter}
{wait:14}or two,{wait:14} or three{wait:14}...

#### 62 ####
The army's been sending a
lot of guys down here...{enter}
But surely, there has to
be a more efficient way
to excavate those ruins!

#### 63 ####
I'm in a 'fix'...
The generator sensor
is broken...{enter}
It's the only thing
that can sense buried
Gear generators...{enter}
Without that, I'm
'ruin'ed!

#### 64 ####
There's a buncha thieves
out in the desert called
Sandmen... So you gotta
equip yourself properly.{enter}
If you don't, you only
have yourself to blame.

#### 65 ####
There's a buncha pirates
in a sand cruiser out in
the desert... So you gotta
equip yourself properly.{enter}
If you don't, you only
have yourself to blame.

#### 66 ####
Taking excavated parts to
the workshop doesn't pay
so well anymore.{enter}
I hear they might downsize
the workshop...times are
tough, I tell ya.

#### 67 ####
Big profits for little work!
That's the best way to make
money... That's the knack!{enter}
We make our money selling
the parts we excavate to
the 'Ethos'.{enter}
The rarer the parts, the
better the price!{wait:14}
'Dig it'!?

#### 68 ####
So...
What do you
want to buy?

#### 69 ####
Fei
"This town's lively."

#### 70 ####
Citan
"This is the center for
all excavations in Aveh.{enter}
People come from all over
Ignas to try and find the
resources buried in the
ruins around here."

rent us this buggy."
