What?{clear:3C}

#### 2 ####
"Hey, come down here now!{wait:1E}
I'm not gonna kill you.{wait:1E}
All I want is for you to
leave this Gear{wait:3C}...{wait:3C} Huh?"

#### 3 ####
"Hey!?{wait:1E}
You're{wait:14} not an
Aveh soldier?"

#### 4 ####
Fei
"I told you that in my
intercom transmission
earlier.{enter}
You're the one who
refused to listen to
me, right?"

#### 5 ####
"Hah, ha, ha. Sorry, sorry.
Yes, I remember you were
saying something like that.{enter}
I went off half-cocked and
thought you were the enemy.{enter}
Uhh, ahem...
My name is Bart.
I'm the pirate that works
this territory."

#### 6 ####
Fei
"My name is Fei.{enter}
I was arrested for no
apparent reason, shoved
into that Aveh transport
ship...{enter}
...And was nearly going to
be sent to a concentration
camp until you went and
blew the thing to blazes.{enter}
Anyway...
I'm just glad to have
been able to survive."

#### 7 ####
Bart
"I see...
Well, I'm glad I at least
helped you out a little.{enter}
But I didn't expect a
civilian like you would
be riding in a military
Gear.{enter}
Besides, this Gear is a
brand new model.
I've never seen this type
before."

#### 8 ####
Fei
"Let's just say that
a lot of things have
happened...{enter}
It wasn't like I
wanted to pilot it!"

#### 9 ####
Fei
"Where are we anyway?
Looks like we fell into
one weird place.{enter}
I've never heard of huge
stalactite caves such as
this existing under the
desert before."

#### 10 ####
Bart
"What? You don't know
anything, do you?{wait:1E}
Where are you from?{enter}
The desert only covers
around 1000 sharls of the
outer layer of the earth.{enter}
The stratum underneath
that consists of igneous
rock."

#### 11 ####
Fei
"From a sea of trees to
a sea of sand...and now
a stalactite cave...{enter}
What's next...?"

#### 12 ####
Bart
"What are you
talking about?"

#### 13 ####
Fei
"Oh, nothing...{wait:1E}
Never mind..."

#### 14 ####
Bart
"We're in trouble...{wait:1E}
Look, the hole we fell
through has disappeared.{enter}
We'd better find some
other way out...{wait:1E}
So, you wanna call a
truce for now?{enter}
...At least until we
find an exit and get
out of here."

#### 15 ####
Fei
"Yes...
agreed.{enter}
First, we gotta find
the way out of here...
So, let's get going..."
