Long ago, humans were with
god in a paradise in the
sky called Mahanon. The
place was protected by the
power of god. Humans were
never exposed to the fear
or danger of death.{enter}
However, one day, humans
entered god's forbidden
garden and ate a fruit
which bestowed upon them
tremendous intelligence
and power.{enter}
God found out about the
incident and the humans
were banished from the
paradise. The prosperous
times were over, an era of
sorrow and hatred began...

#### 2 ####
That was the first part
of the legend of genesis
that was passed on from
long ago.{wait:14} They say a
legend such as this
contains some truth to
it...

#### 3 ####
Humans banished from the
paradise were foolish
enough to revolt against
god.{enter}
In order to resist the
power of god, they
created twelve Anima
Relics, and called
themselves gods...{enter}
For 10 days, 10 nights,
the world shed its blood,
Mahanon was enveloped in 
flames.{enter}
But human strength was no
match for god and the
arrogant humans were
destroyed by god's anger.
Only a few righteous men
were left on the land.{enter}
However, god was also
tired and wounded.
He decided to rest in the
deepest depths of the
earth. {enter}
God's rest was long.
But eternity is only
a moment to god.{enter}
Since then, the righteous
men who didn't revolt
against god had to live
in the harsh nature by
themselves, being in
constant fear of death...

#### 4 ####
The legend also says the
following:{wait:14}
When the righteous men's
children are born again,
god will awaken from his
long rest and give a
helping hand to them.{enter}
If the legend is true,
what will the awakening
god bring to the people?{wait:14}
What kind of existence is
god?

#### 5 ####
It is not known how much of
the genesis legend is true
...{enter}
However, the 'Anima Relics'
made through god's wisdom,
do exist.{enter}
Solaris' Gazel Ministry is
desperate to find the
'Anima Relic' and Mahanon,
a place known to be god's
resting place.{enter}
If Solaris attains that
power, no one will be able
to stop them.{wait:14}
What will happen to the
world then...?
