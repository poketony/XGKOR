"Fei!?"

Fei
"Elly!!"

#### 3 ####
Elly
"Fei, you're so careless.{enter}
If you're trying to
infiltrate the base,
you have to be subtle.

#### 4 ####
Fei
"Sorry...{wait:0A}
Well, where are we?"

#### 5 ####
Elly
"We're in the 'Solaris 3rd
Class F block'.{enter}
There's around 20 blocks
each with land dwellers
living in them.{enter}
We Solarians are privy
to all personal info...{enter}
Everyone's DNA structure
is inscribed on a molecular
level.{enter}
And even their class...{wait:0A}
You know what these
citizens are called?"

#### 6 ####
No...

#### 7 ####
Elly
"'Worker Bees'.{wait:0A}
It came from the shape of
their housing blocks.{enter}
These people provide the
manual labor vital to the
support of Solaris' core.{enter}
I took a field trip here
once long ago. I remember
thinking that their lives
had nothing to do with me.{enter}
I never thought I would
end up here like this..."

#### 8 ####
Fei
"Which means, you should
know your way around here,
Elly."

#### 9 ####
Elly
"Vaguely.{wait:0A}
We need to escape first..."

#### 10 ####
Fei
"Oh yeah, where's doc?"

#### 11 ####
Elly
"He took a different pod
looking for you...{enter}
He may have ended
up in a different block."

#### 12 ####
Fei
"Damn...{wait:0A}
We're all spread out."

#### 13 ####
Elly
"I wouldn't worry about
Citan.{wait:0A} He knows this
city better than I do."

#### 14 ####
Fei
"I wonder if Bart and
them made it OK?"

#### 15 ####
Elly
"Jessie's with them, so
they should be fine."

#### 16 ####
Fei
"I hope so..."

#### 17 ####
Elly
"Anyway, let's move on."
