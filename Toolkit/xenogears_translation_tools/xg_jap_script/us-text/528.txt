fighting!"

Elly
"Some things only the weak
can feel...{enter}
But weakness does not make
them servile.{enter}
It's because they are weak,
that they can develop
kindness...and never look
down on people.{enter}
That is where real human
interaction comes from.
Everyone has weaknesses.
Even you did at first.{enter}
Your weakness drew you to
each other...{enter}
And made you grow strong.
Never forget those feelings.
When you all lived together
side by side..."

Elly
"You've got us all wrong,
Dominia.{enter}
Our paths may be different,
but our goals are the same.{enter}
That's why I can't fight
you anymore. There's no
reason for me to...
That's all."

Dominia
"What took you!?"

#### 6 ####
Dominia
"Silence!
Now we have no choice
but to fight.{enter}
Now we will show you
the true power of the
Elements! Get ready...
because here we come!"

"Elements' Formation!"{clear:28}

Dominia
"Are you trying to show
us mercy? Or are you just
trying to show off...?"

#### 10 ####
Dominia
"Hmph..."

combine our forces!"

"Well{wait:05}...{wait:0A}it looks like
they sure showed us a
thing or two!"

Shopkeep Johnny
"Whoa!
I'm not the enemy!"

#### 14 ####
Shopkeep Johnny
"My family's been merchants
for generations, and we got
our own ways to fight.{enter}
And this is my battle."

Shopkeep Johnny
"Wanna buy something?
I even service Gears."
