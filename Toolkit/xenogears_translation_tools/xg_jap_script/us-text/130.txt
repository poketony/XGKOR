We must rewrite all
false history books
on the monarchy.{enter}
We also must get rid
of any books that
might cause problems.

#### 2 ####
But now, any pre-Shakhan
records are getting dated.
Strange how the present
becomes the past.

#### 3 ####
I am rearranging all the
records that were hidden
from Shakhan.{enter}
I was told to burn them,
but I hid them instead.

#### 4 ####
Do you know the history of Bledavik?
    Yes, I do
    No, I don't

#### 5 ####
Wow, you know a lot.

This city was built on a
desert rockbed. This was
partially to escape sand
erosion, but that's not
all.{enter}
An underground water basin
wells up here. The rockbed
is made of limestone, so
the water level continued
to rise to its present level.{enter}
Fatima Castle was originally
built to protect the water
source, but gradually the
desert people started to
live here.{enter}
They were soon joined by a
steady flow of people from
the northern lands.
That is the story of this
city, Bledavik.

'Aveh's True History'{enter}
...In the dark days of the
Fatima rule, the people had
little to eat and even less
to be happy about.{enter}
Their hardships peaked during
the reign of Edbart IV...{enter}
Using the people's fury as
his power base, Shakhan, the
Prime Minister then, lead
the armies that broke the
tyrany of the Fatima dynasty.{enter}
Those heroes became the 
nucleus of Aveh's current
armed forces...

#### 8 ####
It is said the founder of Aveh,
one Roni Fatima, was part of a
desert caravan, but he probably
also had other sides to him.{enter}
The myths speak of the
involvement of giants in
battles that were part of
a massive power struggle.{enter}
Almost all the records from
that time have been lost, and
what little remains is doubted
as being historically correct.{enter}
But then Roni Fatima could have
been behind altering things.

{fast:FF}There's probably a guard outside...
    Open the door
    Just take a peek
