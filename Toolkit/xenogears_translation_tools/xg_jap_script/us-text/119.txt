"This...
is not good..."{clear:3C}

Bart
"See ya, you bald geezer!
We'll settle this later.
Till then...
go get your
head waxed!"{clear:50}

#### 4 ####
Bart
"Let's go!"

Sigurd
"Crap! An ambush!"

#### 7 ####
Citan
"Oh-oh...!{wait:64}
Where is Kahr...?"

#### 8 ####
Miang
"I see you are quick
to catch on.{enter}
Ramsus should be taking
care of all your divided
forces out by the Nisan
border as we speak.{enter}
Ramsus easily saw through
your plan to use a feint
attack by Kislev long ago.
Don't underestimate us...{enter}
Hyuga, have you lived
down here so long that
your mind has slipped?{enter}
And Sigurd, who would have
thought you would have
joined the last survivors
of the royal dynasty..."

#### 9 ####
Sigurd
"Damn it...why are you
still backing Shakhan?{enter}
What does it matter to
you who the king is?"

#### 10 ####
Miang
"Hah! You suggest the son
of murdered King Fatima?
He refused to cooperate!{enter}
You mean to say that now
he wants to be our
puppet all of a sudden?{enter}
That I don't believe...
even coming from the mouth
of a traitor like you.{enter}
Ha ha ha... Besides,
stupidity in puppets
has its advantages."

#### 11 ####
Shakhan
"Stu, stupidity!?
Miang, what's that
supposed to mean?"

#### 12 ####
Miang
"Minister Shakhan, I'll let
you handle this. You must
protect your own position.{enter}
We don't care who is
sitting on the throne.
Any obedient sheep
would be fine.{enter}
However, isn't there 
something that you
still have to do?{enter}
If you will only do that,
then we'll help you as
much as possible."

#### 13 ####
Shakhan
"Yes, you don't have
to tell me.{enter}
One must take care of
one's own country's
criminals personally."

#### 14 ####
Miang
"Then, with your
permission I shall
take my leave..."

#### 15 ####
Bart
"Hey now! 
Wait a minute!!"

#### 16 ####
Miang
"Goodbye...{wait:32}boys."

#### 17 ####
Shakhan
"You pirate...no you're
just a sandworm. You've
caused me enough shame.{enter}
But this is the end. You
didn't know your place
and now all that awaits
you is annihilation.{enter}
Prepare to fire...!"

#### 18 ####
Shakhan
"Wha!?"

#### 19 ####
Maison
"You wretched rebel,
Shakhan!{enter}
Make one move and
this gatling gun
shall be spitting
fire!"

#### 20 ####
Bart
"Old Maison!"

#### 21 ####
Maison
"Reinforcements have
arrived, young master.
Please come aboard."

#### 22 ####
Maison
"Shall we depart?"

#### 23 ####
Shakhan
"Is this some kind of joke?{wait:64}
Hmm, It seems sandworms
can't fly after all.{enter}
Just surrender.
Thanks for the laughs...
I almost hate to have
to shoot you."

#### 24 ####
Bart
"Crap! I guess we're
gonna get mauled..."

#### 25 ####
Maison
"Everyone...
please get down."

#### 26 ####
Bart
"Do you have a
plan, Maison?"

#### 27 ####
Maison
"Leave it to me."

#### 28 ####
Bart
"Maison, you're just
walking in circles."{clear:64}

#### 29 ####
Maison
"Just leave it to me."{clear:3C}

#### 30 ####
Bart
"You've saved us the
trouble of finding you,
Shakhan! Now get ready!"

#### 31 ####
Shakhan
"We've been
expecting you!"

#### 32 ####
Bart
"What!?"
