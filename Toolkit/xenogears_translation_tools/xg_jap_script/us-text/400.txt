That day, 500 years ago,
that woman was definitely
here...{wait:14}There was no other
alternative but to be a
captive...{enter}
We could've won, at the
cost of many sacrifices!{wait:14}
Only if that traitor
hadn't disappeared with
the woman!!{enter}
The escaped woman freed the
beast. The beast sucked
human blood and ate their
flesh...{wait:14}
And tore the world apart...!

Excuse me...Miss...{wait:14}
You resemble the girl who
was like an angel, and
was sacrificed in the
great war...{enter}
I can picture Zephyr and
the followers' confusion.{wait:14}{enter}
They were the ones who
were actually responsible
for the death of Sophia.{enter}
In actuality, we are still
being punished for that
crime, 500 years ago!{wait:14}
It feels almost
ridiculous, hahah...!

#### 3 ####
Since then, people have
found themselves groping
in the dark.{wait:14}
They've been atoning for a
crime for 500 years...{enter}
I want to you to be
careful, young one. Don't
follow the same path as
the traitor...{wait:14}drowning in
hatred and love...
