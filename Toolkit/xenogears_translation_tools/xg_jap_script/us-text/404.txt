Elly
(I heard there is a hidden
shelter. But do you think
they're alright in there?)

Elly
(I'm sure she was in no
state to be able to just
sit still.)

#### 10 ####
Elly
(I hope it goes OK.)

"Do we have to
walk that far?"

"...Haven't you yourself

Citan
(There are no townspeople
in sight, but Shakhan's
guards are everywhere...)

#### 14 ####
Citan
(It was said that there
is a hidden shelter
facility in the town...{enter}
But whether it was safe
in there or not is
another problem...!)

#### 15 ####
Citan
(It is understandable.{enter}
After hearing Shakhan
has his hands on Nisan,
there is no way she would
just sit and do nothing.)

#### 16 ####
Citan
(Let us just pray
for success.)

(I don't see any sign of

#### 24 ####
Billy
(I've heard of a hidden
shelter, but I wonder if
it was safe in there?)

#### 25 ####
Billy
(Margie's the Great Mother
of this sect, isn't she?{enter}
After hearing that Nisan
may have fallen into the
hands of these villains...{enter}
...there's no way she
would just stand by
and watch it happen.)

#### 26 ####
Billy
(I hope it works out.)

#### 27 ####
Billy
"About how far is it?"

Billy
"What? You haven't been

(Where'd all the
townsfolk go to?)

#### 30 ####
Rico
(I've heard of a hidden
shelter, but do you
think it was safe?)

Rico
(Well, what would you do?
Whether you're the Great
Mother or not...{enter}
...if your own home's
gettin' trashed, you're
not gonna just stand by
and watch it happen.)

Rico
(Hope it works out.)

{name:07:チュチュ}
(Where did all the
townspeople go chu?)

#### 41 ####
{name:07:チュチュ}
(It's going chu be alright!
There's a secret hole.
That's what I heard chu.)

#### 42 ####
{name:07:チュチュ}
(Let her be!{enter}
Margie's chu kind a girl
chu just sit there and
do nothing.)

Maria
(And I don't see
any civilians.)

#### 47 ####
Maria
(I've been informed that
there was an emergency
shelter facility.{enter}
Do you suppose they
took refuge there?)

#### 48 ####
Maria
(How can you blame her?
I kind of know what Margie
may be going through.{enter}
She probably can't stand
to just sit around.)

#### 49 ####
Maria
(Let's hope it all
works out.)

#### 50 ####
Maria
"How long does it take
to get over there?"

#### 51 ####
Maria
"Haven't been inside!?"

#### 52 ####
Margie
"Well, the place is all
sealed up. Even I haven't
been far inside of it."

#### 53 ####
Margie
"Alright then, I'm going
to go on ahead and wait
for you at the entrance."

#### 54 ####
Margie
"Okay!"

#### 55 ####
Hang in there, young one!

#### 56 ####
Yo!{wait:1E} Pres.!!

#### 57 ####
Bart
"Damn, you're funny..."

#### 58 ####
So the young one's gonna
be our president...

#### 59 ####
I wish the children
would return soon...{enter}
A sign of a good town
is one with smiling,
happy children.

#### 60 ####
It doesn't look too good
now, but the townsfolk
will eventually return.{enter}
Everything will be back
the way it was...
I just know it.

#### 61 ####
I certainly hope the world
will change for the better.

"We can't just leave now!"

#### 64 ####
Fei
"We can't just leave now!"

#### 65 ####
Fei
"We can't just leave now!"

#### 66 ####
Fei
"We can't just leave now!"

#### 67 ####
Fei
(The city's awfully quiet
for some reason{wait:0A}...)

#### 68 ####
Bart
(I dunno, but I'd like
to think that everything
is still okay.)

#### 69 ####
Fei
(Yeah, I think I heard Bart
say something about that.{enter}
So you think the townsfolk
went there?)

#### 70 ####
Bart
(How was it over
on your side?)

#### 71 ####
Sigurd
(Everywhere along the
roads was also just as
quiet.)

#### 72 ####
Bart
(... {wait:1E}What's your
take on this, Sig?)

#### 73 ####
Sigurd
(From what little I've
seen, there isn't anything
much I can say.)

#### 74 ####
Bart
(Either they haven't 
found what they are
looking for yet...{enter}
Or they've already found
what they were looking for
but have just left behind
some guards...{enter}
Either way, we still need
to check on the safety
of the residents before we
even think of pulling out.{enter}
Hey, by the way, how is
Margie holding up?)

#### 75 ####
Sigurd
(From the looks of it, she
doesn't seem much different
from her usual self...{enter}
But how she feels on the
inside... well, who's to
know...)

#### 76 ####
Bart
(Really...{wait:1E} Thanks for
looking after her, Sig.)

#### 77 ####
Sigurd
(No problem.
Anyway I shall go and
command the other unit.)

#### 78 ####
Bart
(Alright. Be careful!)

#### 79 ####
Bart
(Margie...{wait:1E}
I thought I told her to
stay put in our ship.)

#### 80 ####
Bart
(Yeah, I know but...{wait:1E}
Well, she's come this far,
so we can't stop her now.)

#### 81 ####
Bart
(Alright then...{wait:1E}
Let's get movin'.)

#### 82 ####
Fei
(How was it on your side?)

#### 83 ####
Sigurd
(The side roads are also
similarly quiet.)

#### 84 ####
Fei
(I see.{wait:1E}
So, what now...?)

#### 85 ####
Sigurd
(Hmm, just from what little
I've seen I can't tell what
their next move might be.{enter}
But, we can't just leave...
considering the residents
were placed in danger
because of our treasure.)

#### 86 ####
Fei
(Okay, agreed.{wait:1E}
But by the way, is
Margie doing alright?)

#### 87 ####
Sigurd
(Well, about that...{enter}
The young master is quite
concerned that Marguerite
has tagged along.)

#### 88 ####
Sigurd
(Yes, but you know him...)

#### 89 ####
Sigurd
(Well, I should get going.{enter}
We'll coordinate our
moves according to yours
and try to break through
the rear path.)

#### 90 ####
Fei
(Yeah.)

#### 91 ####
Citan
(But now that we have heard
and seen so many things up
until now...{enter}
We should realize that
Shakhan's existence is
no longer just the young
one's problem.{enter}
If we do not stop Shakhan
and his men here, the next
time it may be us who face
such a misfortune.{enter}
Let us brace ourselves and
help these people out!)

#### 92 ####
Fei
(But now that we have heard
and seen so many things up
until now...{enter}
We should realize that
Shakhan's existence is
no longer just Bart's
problem.{enter}
If we do not stop Shakhan
and his men here, the next
time it may be us who face
a similar crisis.{enter}
Let us brace ourselves and
go help our friends out!)

#### 93 ####
Fei
(Okay then, let's go!)

#### 94 ####
 ! 

#### 95 ####
Fei
"Good! Looks like we
cleaned up all the soldiers
who were in the town."

#### 96 ####
Sigurd
"There are no signs of
residents...{wait:1E} yet."

#### 97 ####
Fei
"Well, let's get goin'.{enter}
Where's this mausoleum?"

#### 98 ####
Bart
"There's an entrance at
the rear of the cathedral.{enter}
So first of all, we have to
get on the road that runs
around this town and go in
through the back way."

#### 99 ####
Bart
"The distance to the
mausoleum isn't that
much...{enter}
But, I don't know
how much more there
is to go from there."

#### 100 ####
Fei
"You haven't been inside
there yourself Bart?"

#### 101 ####
Bart
"Yeah...{wait:1E}
This is my first time to go
beyond the mausoleum too."

#### 102 ####
Bart
"So neither Margie nor
I know much about it.{enter}
Sig and them have already
taken off, so we won't be
able to return to the ship
for a while.{enter}
For now, we're just gonna
have to work this out on
our own."

#### 103 ####
Bart
"We'll come once we
finish our preparations.{enter}
So could you wait for
us at the entrance
until then?"

#### 104 ####
Bart
"Alright...{wait:1E}
let's get prepped."

#### 105 ####
Fei
"But, by the looks of it,
I don't think we'll be able
to find the tool lady."

#### 106 ####
Bart
"Hmm... Why don't we just
leave the necessary money
behind then?{enter}
Sure it might not be good
manners, but I'm sure they
will forgive me..."

#### 107 ####
"Chasing Shakhan from the
world map to the Gate."
