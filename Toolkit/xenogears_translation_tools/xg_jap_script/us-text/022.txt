Fei?

#### 3 ####
Elly
"...Are you awake?"

#### 4 ####
Elly
"Yesterday you said your
life was worthless. What
did you mean by that?"

#### 5 ####
Fei
"Why are you asking?"

#### 6 ####
Elly
"Why? Yesterday you looked
like you had a death wish.{enter}
You think it wouldn't make
me wonder...?{wait:14} Say, how did
you get stranded in this
forest in the first place?"

#### 7 ####
Fei
"I should ask you
the same question."

#### 8 ####
Elly
"Huh? Well,
I, errh..."

#### 9 ####
Fei
"I...{wait:1E}ran away...{wait:1E}
from my village...{wait:1E}
or what's left of it..."

#### 10 ####
Elly
"Village...?
You don't mean...!?"

#### 11 ####
Fei
"Lahan...{enter}
It was a small village that
existed between this forest
and the mountain range.
I ran away from there."

#### 12 ####
Elly
"That village...?"

#### 13 ####
Fei
"It was a nice, peaceful
village. Everyone there
treated me like family.{enter}
Then, last night, a group
of Gears suddenly appeared
and started fighting right
in the middle of the place.{enter}
The village was engulfed in
flames... I couldn't just
stand there and watch
Lahan be destroyed...{enter}
So to try and save the
villagers, I got in an
empty Gear...without even
knowing how to operate it.{enter}
I just thought maybe I
could do it...no...it
was more like someone
whispering to me...{enter}
Someone whispering to me...
telling me to do it...
But it was a disaster!
The village..."

#### 14 ####
Elly
"Was it destroyed by
the Kislev army?"

#### 15 ####
Elly
"Fei...?"

#### 16 ####
Fei
"No... The village was
destroyed...{wait:32}by me..."

#### 17 ####
!?{clear:1E}

#### 18 ####
Fei
"Yes. It was me.
I destroyed Lahan.
I'm sure of it..."

#### 19 ####
Elly
"What do you mean
you destroyed it?{enter}
I thought you were
trying to help save
the villagers?"

#### 20 ####
Fei
"I did try to help.
I actually took out
a few Gears.{enter}
But then I came under
heavy fire from a new
group of Gears...{enter}
And then my friend...{wait:0A}
Timothy...{wait:0A}was hit by
a hail of bullets...{enter}
Then I lost it...{wait:0A}
Everything just went
dark..."

#### 21 ####
Fei
"I don't remember anything
after that.{enter}
The Gear I was in went out
of control...
Well, that's what doc said.{enter}
When I came to...
the village...
and everyone in it...
was...{enter}
Alice... She was such a...
Alice and Timothy...
Oh god...! Everybody...
All such good people..."

#### 22 ####
Elly
"Went out of control...?
The Gear...?
What about the village?"

#### 23 ####
Elly
"Fei?"

#### 24 ####
Fei
"...Yes, the Gear!{enter}
If only those Gears
had never landed in
the village...!"

#### 25 ####
Fei
"If they had never come
to the village, never
started fighting there...{enter}
Then I wouldn't have
tried to pilot that Gear.
It's all their fault...
Not mine!{enter}
They're the ones to blame.
If they'd never come...
none of this would have...
...if not for them!"

#### 26 ####
Elly
"Enough of that!"

#### 27 ####
!?

#### 28 ####
Elly
"You're a coward!"

#### 29 ####
Fei
"A coward?
...Me?"

#### 30 ####
Elly
"Yes, you're a coward.
All you're saying is
'them, them, them'.{enter}
Don't talk as if you
had no part of the
blame, as well!"

#### 31 ####
Fei
"I'm to blame...?"

#### 32 ####
Elly
"Yes, that's right!{enter}
Of course the direct cause
of the battle was that a
Gear made an emergency
landing in your village.{enter}
But all Kislev wanted was
the Gear, right?
They weren't invading or
out to destroy Lahan.{enter}
The real damage occured
because you climbed in a
Gear and tried to fight
back!"

#### 33 ####
Fei
"..."

#### 34 ####
Elly
"What ever made you get
into that Gear?{enter}
Not just anyone can pilot
them! It takes training!
There is no way a civilian
could hope to pilot one!{enter}
Besides...you should have
been helping the villagers
flee to safety instead!{enter}
How can you blame the
damage on a Gear when it
was your decision to fight
in it in the first place?{enter}
Why don't you take some of
the responsiblity yourself?
Why are you putting all the
blame on others?{enter}
That's just running away!
That's what makes you a
coward!"

#### 35 ####
Fei
"Well, if you put it that
way... Yes...that's right,
I am a coward!{enter}
I didn't realize my own
strength and have been
blaming what happened as a
result of that on others.{enter}
I'm a pitiful excuse for a
man.
But...{enter}
I just felt this rush of
blood in me and I couldn't
help myself! Couldn't help
myself...or help others."

#### 36 ####
Elly
"Fei, I, I'm..."

#### 37 ####
Fei
"Shut up!!
What do you know!?{enter}
When I came to I was
surrounded by piles
of rubble...{enter}
I didn't know what had
happened or what I had
done. I remembered
absolutely nothing.{enter}
All I knew was that my
hands could still feel
what they had done.{enter}
The only things that
penetrated the Gear's
barrier were screams...{enter}
Screams accompanied by
the stench of blood, the
sound of crushing bones,
and my own curses.

#### 38 ####
Look! Look at my hands!
Can you hear their voices?
Can you understand this
feeling?{enter}
The feeling of having
destroyed your village
with your own hands...?{enter}
Of not being able to do
anything for the children
left behind...?{enter}
Now they have nothing...
I have nothing...
I have nowhere...
no one..."

#### 39 ####
Fei
"I didn't want to get in
it... I had no choice...
There was no other way..."

#### 40 ####
Fei
"Oh no!"

#### 41 ####
Elly
"Fei..."
