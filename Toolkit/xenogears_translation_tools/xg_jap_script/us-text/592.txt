"Elly will be back to
her usual self! I will
go on believing that.{enter}
But even if that doesn't
happen...I will still...
...Well, let's just say
I'm prepared for that too!"

#### 2 ####
Zephyr
"You don't have to do
this if you don't want
to, you know.{enter}
Your opponent is the
person you love...
If you decide to quit now,
no one will blame you."

#### 3 ####
Fei
"To quit would be
meaningless.{enter}
All that I have fought for,
and all that I live for,
would come to have no
meaning at all...{enter}
People should be free. With
no one bound by others, and
no one binding others...{enter}
Inside of me, there is a
part of me that desires
that freedom, and a part
of me that gives me hope.{enter}
So, I shall fight to
win true freedom!
For we are still alive!{enter}
We fight to live.
That is the reason
why I fight.
It's proof I'm human.{enter}
I promised my father, and
myself too, that I would
free Elly from Deus' binds,
that I would save her..."

#### 4 ####
Zephyr
"I understand.{wait:14}
So, let's keep believing...
And hope for a miracle..."

Fei
"According to what the doc
says, his condition has
gotten a lot better.{enter}
It seems like Kahr has
regained his will to
live again."

#### 6 ####
Fei
"So much has happened
between him and I...{enter}
When this battle ends, I
want to face Ramsus one
on one in sport, not war,
as a martial artist."

#### 7 ####
Fei
"Perhaps..."

#### 8 ####
Citan
"Yes, well, at first, he
had lost faith in himself
but now he is better.{enter}
Kahr has revived himself,
and has found some real
meaning in his life.{enter}
If he decides to fight on
our side then our total
fighting power shall be
greatly increased."

#### 9 ####
Zephyr
"The snow keeps falling...{wait:14}
Softly covering up
everything in this world...{enter}
Our sorrow, our defilement,
our mistakes...{wait:14} If only we
could wipe away these
things as easily as that...{enter}
What have we...{wait:14}have I...{wait:14}
been doing...{wait:14}
been pursuing...{wait:14}
for these past 500 years?"

#### 10 ####
Zephyr
"By the way...{wait:14}
How is the person you
rescued from Merkava?{enter}
I heard he recovered
consciousness..."

#### 11 ####
Zephyr
"I am sure he wishes
the same thing too."

#### 12 ####
Zephyr
"Fei...
May I ask you something?{enter}
About Elly...{wait:14}
What if, even if we break
Zohar's spell, she doesn't
return to normal..."
