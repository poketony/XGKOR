Maria
"This way, please."

#### 2 ####
We aren't permitted to
leave here no matter what.{enter}
So please, take good care
of Maria for us!

#### 3 ####
How's the surface doing,
lately?{enter}
I'm sure the people down
there are living blindly
yet peacefully as usual.

#### 4 ####
Are you the newcomers from
the outside?{wait:14} Maria isn't
with you?

#### 5 ####
It's truly unfortunate
about Professor Nikolai...{enter}
But thanks to you all, we
were able to repel the
enemy.{enter}
Thank you.{wait:14} And let's
continue to work together
to take down Solaris!

#### 6 ####
In hopes of making contact
with you and your friends
on the ocean surface...{enter}
...the shields were
apparently dropped.{enter}
That's when they took
advantage of the situation.{enter}
Who would've ever thought
there would actually be a
spy that would get in!?

#### 7 ####
I seriously doubt any spy
would be able to get in.{enter}
And as I expected, since
we have new people from
the surface, there's
increased security.{enter}
And you never know what
might happen...{wait:14} If anything
ever happened to the Queen,
it'd be disastrous.

#### 8 ####
From here on, I cannot
allow you to freely enter
or leave.{wait:14} I am sorry.

#### 9 ####
This is the library where
many books are gathered.{enter}
This place is packed with
many ancient books that
you cannot find on the
surface.{enter}
If you're a book fanatic,
you'd drool over books
like our first run prints,
limited books, autograph...{enter}
...books, banned books, and
mountains of hard to find
books, and more mountains
and mountains of books...!{enter}
Ahhh! It's too much!

#### 10 ####
Well, setting that aside...{enter}
If there's something you
want to know about from the
past, it'd be good to go in
and talk to the librarians.{enter}
Don't worry.{wait:14} It's their
job anyway to tell the new
people from the surface
about the past.

#### 11 ####
...Sigh... Will the day
ever come when I will be
able to live peacefully
on the surface?

#### 12 ####
Welcome to Shevat.{wait:14} We've
already heard that you are
our guests.{enter}
Please use this room as you
please.{wait:14} You are welcome to
use the bed to rest.

#### 13 ####
When Maria leaves, this
town's going to be just
that much more lonelier.{enter}
But, I guess there's no
way around it.{enter}
There comes a time, for
everyone, when they must
embark on their own path.

#### 14 ####
Maria has truly done so
much for us. As of now...{enter}
...many of us consider her
to be the guardian angel
of Shevat.{enter}
Regardless of how well
she can control
{name:13:ゼプツェン}, she's
only a 13 years old girl.{enter}
She's probably worried sick
about her father who's been
captured by Solaris...

#### 15 ####
Who would've ever thought
that would happen to
Professor Nikolai...{enter}
What are we to say to
Maria?

#### 16 ####
Balthasar has strongly told
Maria not to leave Shevat
under any circumstances.{enter}
He probably said that
because he knows that if
provided with the chance...{enter}
...that child would
immediately try to fly off
to Solaris...{enter}
All by herself, to rescue
her captured father,
riding on the
{name:13:ゼプツェン}...

#### 17 ####
The powerless are maimed
and slaughtered all because
those crazed leaders give
out one bloodlusted order.{enter}
It doesn't matter how
advanced their technology
or culture is.{enter}
It's the same thing. Not
one thing has changed over
the years.{enter}
It's gotten so sad, you can
almost laugh! Hah! How long
does this have to last...?

#### 18 ####
To protect Shevat from the
outside, the ancient
technology of the Gate is
used.{enter}
It's fundamentally the same
thing as the stuff Solaris
has planted on the surface.{enter}
Even with Solaris'
technology, the Gate cannot
be broken through.{enter}
But at times, I come to
think about whether this
Gate is only for protecting
us from Solaris?{enter}
Maybe that man left this
Gate behind to separate us.
To isolate us from the rest
of the world.{enter}
If that was his intention,
then Krelian is indeed
dreadful... Does that man's
resentment run that deep...

#### 19 ####
Krelian holds the true
power in Solaris is what
I'm saying... The irony
of fate.{enter}
Once, that man fought
alongside Roni Fatima,
Queen Zephyr and Lacan
against Solaris...

#### 20 ####
Uuhhh, so hungry... Is the
meal ready yet?{wait:14} Whatever
you do, it all goes back to
food. You got that? Food!{enter}
For me, I get the feeling
I'm most alive when I'm
eating.{wait:14} Isn't it the same
with you guys?{enter}
You eat to live or live to
eat. We don't even know,
do we?{enter}
I bet those Solarians are
always eating all the good
stuff.{wait:14} Argh!
That's unforgivable!!

#### 21 ####
That great war 500 years
ago, I can remember it
like it was yesterday...{enter}
That's something I can't
get myself to forget.{enter}
Many lives were lost...
Much love, many dreams,
friends, those...{enter}
...irreplaceably important
things in our lives were
scarred and left to
bleed...{enter}
Are those days going to
return once again...?{enter}
I don't want my children or
grandchildren to go through
that nightmare...

#### 22 ####
You humans are truly
unusual living beings,
aren't chu?{enter}
You're all like shattered
fragments of a mirror.

#### 23 ####
Further down is the prison.{wait:14}
It hasn't been used for
several hundred years
though.{enter}
It isn't anything worth
seeing.{enter}
Well, I guess you could
say we had a similar
barbaric phase like the
land dwellers!

#### 24 ####
This is the tactical
command room.{enter}
Currently, we are keeping
track of the activities of
both Solaris and the
land and collecting data.{enter}
However, who would have
thought they'd attack in
such a way...{wait:14} Aren't they
being a bit hasty?

#### 25 ####
This is the tactical
command room.{enter}
Currently, we are keeping
track of the activities of
both Solaris and the
land and collecting data.{enter}
Lately, there's been a lot
of unusual activity down on
the surface...{enter}
Hmm. You think Solaris
found something?

#### 26 ####
Yeah, that was an
incredible battle.{wait:14}
Thanks to you all, we're
somehow still here.{enter}
Thank you so much.{wait:14} We're
depending on you till
the day we bring freedom
back to the surface.

#### 27 ####
So you're the newcomers
from the surface?{wait:14} Hmm...{enter}
It seems you all aren't
like the usual land
dwellers we get.{enter}
But we're always happy to
have more friends to fight
against Solaris.{enter}
I look forward to working
with you.

#### 28 ####
Go down?{wait:14}
    Yes
    No

#### 29 ####
Oh my, this has gotten
serious.{wait:14} It seems you can't
get in because of the
emergency security.{enter}
But, you are all lucky.{wait:14}
A legendary vendor like
me happens to be here
through coincidence.{enter}
I've got a line of quality
goods, sir... So, if you've
got anything you need,{wait:14}
don't hesitate to ask.

#### 30 ####
Alright, then what
shall it be?

#### 31 ####
    Items
    Weapon/Armor
    Gear Parts
    Nevermind

#### 32 ####
Thank you very much.{wait:14}
If there's anything you
need, please come by
again.

#### 33 ####
Looong ago, I've heard that
a lone Chu-chu was taken
from the town by a wise
man...{enter}
It looks like she's been
well.{wait:14} On top of that, she's
gotten so big and grand...{enter}
It's truly a surprise!{wait:14}
Wonder what she was eating.

#### 34 ####
Looong ago, I've heard
that a lone Chu-chu was
taken from the town by
Wiseman...{enter}
I haven't heard what
happened after that.{wait:14}
I hope that Chu-chu
is doing well...
