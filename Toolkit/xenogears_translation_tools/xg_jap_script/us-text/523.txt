There, humans fought
amongst themselves
greedily for limited
pardons to live.{enter}
It was an ugly battle
to keep on living.
Or so it may have seemed
to the casual passerby...{enter}
But to me they were
desperately trying to live.
It was each person's
'natural human form'.

#### 2 ####
There were the 'haves'
and the 'have-nots'...{wait:5A}
And...among them...
were some of my former
friends from Solaris...

#### 3 ####
They wanted our flesh
and blood. They told us,
the 'haves' should share
with the 'have-nots'.{wait:3C}
 
They asked if a 'have',
such as myself could
understand their pain...

#### 4 ####
I couldn't answer...{wait:3C}
 
No matter what I said it
would have sounded like a
conceited 'have' speaking...{wait:3C}
 
Even so, I wanted to
relieve their anguish...
And I decided to do so.

#### 5 ####
Just like the person in the
memory of my dreams...{wait:3C}
in the distant past...

#### 6 ####
Then suddenly the System went
out of control!
The 'Sufal Mass', a monstrous
organism still in the process
of amalgamation, broke through
the barrier of the life-support
facilities and stood before us.

#### 7 ####
No longer of human form...
that which was once human
began eating the people
gathered there seeking
relief...{enter}
We had to fight it...
In order to save the people
and in order to save 'him'...
 
The eyes of that which was
once human looked at me,
pleading for{wait:05}...{wait:05}death{wait:05}...{wait:05}
to take away the agony.

Elly
"Citan...{wait:14}
please lend me
your sword."

#### 9 ####
Elly
"Please!{wait:0A} Listen to me!{wait:0A}
Stop fighting among your-
selves. We are all humans!"

#### 10 ####
Elly
"This facility was built
by the Solaris Ministry...{enter}
It was created to implement
their 'no waste' plan.{enter}
Such facilities were to
convert mutated humans
into weapons that serve as
tools for their ambitions.{enter}
Just one part of their
overall plan of racial
purification."

#### 11 ####
Sophia
"Of course, once you
enter their umbrella
of protection...{enter}
...you can avoid
absolute death.
But is that human life?{enter}
Even if you are the only
one left, if you're
devoid of a heart,
what does it all mean?"

#### 12 ####
Elly
"All of you, want to be
loved...needed by someone,
so we look to others...{enter}
By ourselves, we are
lonely, so we try to
draw close together to
live...{enter}
That's what it means to
be human...
That's how people live.{enter}
A single hand cannot
clap."

#### 13 ####
Sophia
"To relieve your pain,
I'll give however much
of my flesh you need.{enter}
Therefore...{wait:1E}
don't throw away your
dignity as humans...{enter}
Don't let go of your
human heart..."

#### 14 ####
Fei
"Elly...!
Are you okay? {wait:1E}
What are you doing?"

#### 15 ####
Elly
"You think I am doing
something...foolish?"

#### 16 ####
Fei
"No..."

#### 17 ####
Elly
"I only did what I could.
Maybe I'm a hypocrite.
A well-to-do 'have'.{enter}
Maybe it's only pity for
the 'have nots'...{enter}
But if I can know the joy
of giving out a little of
the life within me...{enter}
Then maybe someday it may
just be possible that one
human can truly give love
to another...{enter}
People can do it...
I truly believe they can.
That's why..."

#### 18 ####
Fei
"Elly..."
