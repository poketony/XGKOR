button...{wait:0F}assuming that your
opponent is on your right
(from your viewpoint) then:{enter}
¡¤ UP moves your Gear back
 away from the screen.{wait:2D}
¡¤ DOWN moves your Gear in
 towards the screen.{enter}
¡¤ RIGHT moves your Gear
 towards your opponent.{wait:2D}
¡¤ LEFT moves your Gear
 away from your opponent.

#### 10 ####
Informationist
"Lastly, when you're close
to your opponent, pressing
LEFT invokes a special move
momentary back acceleration!{enter}
This momentarily distances
you from your opponent (or
allows you to 'run away')!{wait:1E}
Just remember the opposite
direction to your opponent.

#### 11 ####
Informationist
"That's it in a nutshell!{wait:1E}
It's probably easier to get
the idea by actually trying
your hand at the controls!"

"The ¡Á button is ATTACK.{wait:0F}
(There are 3 attack buttons
and ¡Á is one of them.){enter}
It changes from Gear to Gear
but is mainly meant for
close combat.{wait:0F} And you're not
limited to just one blow.{enter}
By combining the ¡Á and ¡õ
buttons you are able to make
a chain of attacks up to
three long!{enter}

such combinations that you
can use!"

Oh, and it's alright to use
the R1 button to make Ether
Bullet attacks too!

Although it is said that 
'offense is the best form
of defense', at times it is
important to defend oneself.{enter}

button to GUARD you! {wait:0F} But,{wait:05} 
it doesn't prevent all of
the damage so be careful!"

#### 18 ####
Informationist
"The R1 button launches a 
special attack called 'Ether 
Bullet'.{wait:0F} It's good for long
range attacks on your foe!{enter}
'Ether Bullets' have homing

rely on them, but you might
regret it if you use them

Citan
"You have got a point.{wait:1E}{enter}
Compared to the Champ's
Gear, the quality just
does not match up."

Hammer
"There's nothing we can do.{enter}
Master Rico's Gear is a
special make of Gear
provided by the Committee.{enter}
From maintainence to parts,
it receives the best of
everything.{enter}
As long as money is
involved, the Champ will go
all out.{enter}
That's one of the reasons
he's so powerful{wait:05}...{wait:05}"

from the Aveh
tournament{wait:05}...{wait:05}"

I'm busy right now!"

#### 39 ####
Wiseman
"Hmph.{enter}
No matter how high
quality your Gear may
be, you won't be able
to defeat him."

#### 40 ####
Fei
"Wh,{wait:05} what're you
talking about!?"

#### 41 ####
!?

#### 42 ####
Wiseman
"You still do not
understand do you?{wait:0F} Then
let me show you."

#### 43 ####
Wiseman
"Fighting brute strength
with brute strength is a
sign of a great fool.{enter}
It's obvious that a lighter
body such as yours will
always be at a disadvantage
in a head-on attack.{enter}
I just gave you a good
example. That minor
difference between you and
I had this outcome.{enter}
Now, someone else with a
mass several times as you,
like Rico, the outcome
becomes highly apparent.{enter}
This applies to Gears
as well...{enter}
Even if you were to get
parts comparable to
Rico's, there is still
that difference in mass.{enter}
To make up for this, one
must commit to a single
final strike that thrusts
at the opponent's fissure."

#### 44 ####
Fei
"{wait:05}...{wait:05}?"

#### 45 ####
Wiseman
"I have given you the
hint.{enter}
It's up to you to figure
it out through experience."

#### 46 ####
Fei
"Wait!{wait:0F} Why is it that you
have the same fighting
style as I!?{enter}
And, how do you know my
name!?{wait:0F}
Tell me!"

#### 47 ####
Wiseman
"Hmph{wait:05}...{wait:0F}fine."

#### 48 ####
Wiseman
"It was 3 years ago{wait:05}...{enter}
The one who took you,{wait:05} in
your mutilated state,{wait:05} to
that mountain village was
none other than myself."

#### 49 ####
Fei
"You're the one who
brought me to Lahan!?"

#### 50 ####
Wiseman
"{wait:05}...{wait:05}Yes.{wait:0F}
At your father's
request."

#### 51 ####
Fei
"My father's{wait:05}...!?{wait:1E}
What's your relation to
my father!?"

#### 52 ####
Wiseman
"Khan and I were
fellow students."

#### 53 ####
Fei
"{wait:05}...{wait:05}Khan?{wait:1E} Is that my
father's name?"

#### 54 ####
Wiseman
"Why do you ask for your
father's name?{wait:14} You
haven't lost your{wait:05}...{wait:05}?"

#### 55 ####
Fei
"Yeah{wait:05}...{wait:05}
So tell me anything you
can.{wait:1E} Will you?"

#### 56 ####
Wiseman
"I see{wait:05}...{wait:1E}
In your injured state{wait:05}...{wait:05}{enter}
I wouldn't have been
surprised{wait:05}...{wait:05}"

#### 57 ####
Fei
"Wiseman."

#### 58 ####
Wiseman
"{wait:05}...{wait:05}Khan Wong.{enter}
That is your father's
name.{wait:05} Since our youth,
Khan and I studied the
martial arts together{wait:05}...{wait:05}"

#### 59 ####
Fei
"Father and you{wait:05}...{wait:05}?"

#### 60 ####
Wiseman
"...Yes. Eventually, your
father became an officer
of a certain country.{enter}
There he met a young
woman.
She was about 20 years old.
Her name was 'Karen'.{enter}
She was like a flower in
full bloom."

#### 61 ####
Fei
"Flower{wait:05}...{wait:05}?"

#### 62 ####
Citan
"He means that she was
extraordinarily
beautiful."

#### 63 ####
Fei
"I, see.{wait:0F}
Then she's{wait:05}...{wait:05}?"

#### 64 ####
Wiseman
"Yes, your mother.{wait:1E}{enter}
Khan married your mother,
and I left on a journey
to strengthen myself."

#### 65 ####
Fei
"Then my mother?{wait:0F}
Where is my mother now?"

#### 66 ####
Wiseman
"You do not remember that
either?{wait:0F} {wait:05}...{wait:05}I see.{enter}
{wait:05}...{wait:05}According to Khan,{wait:0A}
when you were but a
child, she passed away."

#### 67 ####
Fei
"Oh{wait:05}...{wait:05}...{wait:05}"

#### 68 ####
Wiseman
"Time passed.{wait:1E} During my
journey, I received a
letter from Khan."

#### 69 ####
Wiseman
"The letter said that,
his son{wait:05}...{wait:0F}was taken away
by a man.{enter}
Khan once said you had
special powers.{wait:14}
The man who wanted that
power took you.{enter}
That man was{wait:0F} Grahf."

#### 70 ####
Fei
"Grahf!?{wait:0A}
He took me away!?"

#### 71 ####
Wiseman
"You've{wait:0F} met him?"

#### 72 ####
Fei
"Yeah{wait:05}...{wait:05}
three times."

#### 73 ####
Wiseman
"It's amazing you are
still in one piece."

#### 74 ####
Fei
"It seemed to Grahf,
that I was still not
powerful enough to{enter}
achieve his ultimate
goal{wait:05}...{wait:05} Anyway,{wait:0F} let me
hear more about this
story."

#### 75 ####
Wiseman
"Khan wished to go find
his son,{wait:0A} and if possible,
he wanted my help{wait:05}...{wait:05}"

#### 76 ####
Wiseman
"I agreed to Khan's
request and began
searching for you...{enter}
...and that man."

#### 77 ####
Wiseman
"Then came that one
fateful night 3 years
ago.{enter}
There was a violent
storm. The storm felt
as if it was thrown at
us through sheer rage.{enter}
That night, Khan
notified me that he
had located his son.{enter}
So I headed for that
location, as if I was
drawn to it."

#### 78 ####
Wiseman
"You and Khan were
wounded badly.{enter}
I have no idea what had
happened between you two
and Grahf. By then, Grahf
had already gone.{enter}
I don't know why, but
probably he was driven
away by Khan.{enter}
Khan decided to pursue
Grahf and left me to
care for his son.{enter}
I provided you with the
necessary first aid and
left you in the custody
of those village people.{enter}
Then I followed after
Khan."

#### 79 ####
Wiseman
"You probably lost
your memory when you
were injured then."

#### 80 ####
Fei
"Why did my father
pursue Grahf?"

#### 81 ####
Wiseman
"I do not even know.
Just that he said it was
not only for the sake of{enter}
his son, but also for the
sake of the world, that
that man had to be
disposed of{wait:05}...{wait:05}He added{enter}
that if something were to
happen to him, I would
have to take care of the
rest{wait:05}...{wait:05}I haven't seen or{enter}
heard from him since."

#### 82 ####
Fei
"Grahf said that my
father was{wait:0A} dead{wait:05}..."

#### 83 ####
Wiseman
"Hmmm{wait:05}...{wait:05} If Grahf has
been appearing in your
presence{wait:05}...{wait:0F} then that is{enter}
a possibility{wait:05}...{wait:1E} That is
truly unfortunate..."

#### 84 ####
Wiseman
"Do you remember anything
about your fighting
techniques?"

#### 85 ####
Fei
"Huh?{wait:0F}
No{wait:05}...{wait:05}nothing{wait:05}...{wait:05}"

#### 86 ####
Wiseman
"Hmmm,{wait:05} your fighting
skills{wait:05} were probably
taught to you by{wait:05} Khan.{enter}
Khan and I both studied
under the same master.{wait:0F}
That is why my techniques
are similar to yours."

#### 87 ####
Wiseman
"Well then, I must
be off."

#### 88 ####
Fei
"To where?"

#### 89 ####
Wiseman
"I will go find him.{wait:1E}
I need to pinpoint what
his intentions are."

#### 90 ####
Wiseman
"{wait:05}...{wait:05}And also, for
Khan's sake."

#### 91 ####
Fei
"Just tell me one thing.{wait:0F}
What country was my
father an officer for?"

#### 92 ####
Wiseman
"Are you going there?"

#### 93 ####
Fei
"I don't know.{wait:14}
There are other things I
have to take care of{wait:05}...{wait:05}"

#### 94 ####
Wiseman
"Yes."

#### 95 ####
Wiseman
"The floating land
which tries to hide
behind a wall, protected,{enter}
as if to conceal their
failure. That is Shevat."

#### 96 ####
Wiseman
"That is your father's
country."

#### 97 ####
Fei
"Shevat{wait:05}...{wait:05}?{wait:0F}
The{wait:05}...{wait:05}floating land?"

#### 98 ####
Wiseman
"Farewell."

#### 99 ####
Fei
"Hey!"

#### 100 ####
Citan
"{wait:05}...{wait:05}What a mysterious
person. {enter}
Is this the second time
you have met him?"

#### 101 ####
Fei
"Huh?{wait:05} ...{wait:05}Yeah.{enter}
Since that tournament in
Aveh.{wait:0F} He sure is a
mysterious person{wait:05}...{wait:05}"

#### 102 ####
Fei
"I probably won't
understand straight away
what he meant today{wait:05}...{enter}
But I think I get the
general idea. I might be
able to do something in
tomorrow's final round{wait:05}...{enter}
The differences in the
performance of the Gear
parts are not going to
influence the outcome...{enter}
...Well, not as much as I
thought before."

#### 103 ####
Citan
"Never underestimate the
situation.{enter}
You might lose pretty
badly if you think you
can just win by getting
a grasp of the concept."

#### 104 ####
Fei
"I know,{wait:05} doc."

#### 105 ####
Citan
"Well,{wait:05} let us return to
our quarters and rest,
Fei{wait:05}...{enter}
Your fate lies in the
outcome of tomorrow's
competition. You need to
preserve your strength."

#### 106 ####
Fei
"Hey, {wait:05}is this...!?"

#### 107 ####
Hammer
"This must be the Gear
that was furnished by
the committee!"

#### 108 ####
Citan
"{wait:05}...{wait:05}My this IS a
surprise."

#### 109 ####
Fei
"Doc!?"

#### 110 ####
Citan
"{wait:05}...{wait:05}Hmmm. I do not think
this is coincidental{wait:05}...{wait:05}
{wait:05}...{wait:05}I am simply assuming,{wait:05}{enter}
but they probably
intentionally furnished
you with {name:0B:¥ô¥§¥ë¥È©`¥ë} to
collect some data."

#### 111 ####
Fei
"Intentionally?"

#### 112 ####
Citan
"Battling itself serves
as one of Kislev's plans.{enter}
From Battling, they can
obtain the various combat
data...{enter}
...and talented Battlers
which can be used for the
military."

#### 113 ####
Fei
"Exactly what kind of
data could they get outta
him and I{wait:05}...{wait:05}?"

#### 114 ####
Citan
"I would not know."

#### 115 ####
Citan
"But I can assure you
that this has something
to do with that incident{enter}
with Aveh{wait:05}...{wait:05}"

#### 116 ####
Citan
"Well, regardless of what
the empire is up to,
this is good for us."

#### 117 ####
Citan
"You are able to get the
Gear you are most used
to."

#### 118 ####

this just enhanced our
probability of escaping{wait:05}...{wait:05}"
