Bart
"Let's split up!{enter}
I'll go to the mausoleum.{wait:1E}
I'll take Fei and..."{wait:1E}

#### 2 ####
Bart
"I see, that'll be good.{wait:1E}
Then please go help Sig!"

#### 3 ####
"So, if that's the case
then..."

#### 7 ####
How's Bledavik?

#### 8 ####
It's under martial law so
it's gotten progressively
harder to contact our
agents in the city.{enter}
According to the info we
finally got just a while
ago, there's no major
activity. {enter}
We think they've found
some reason to attack and
are getting ready now..."

#### 9 ####
The possiblity exists.

#### 10 ####
However I've heard that
Shakhan's powerbase in the
capital is erroding away.{enter}
He's probably weaker than
we thought.

#### 11 ####
Anyway, it's happened and
we're committed now.

#### 12 ####
I feel the same way.

#### 13 ####
Now that I think about it,
12 years ago...

#### 14 ####
Ever since the coup d'etat
by Shakhan, there's been
a lot of tension in our
country.{enter}
With Marguerite back now, 
I agree that the former
dynasty should be returned
to power.

#### 15 ####
Everyone feels the same
but we must look at reality.{enter}
Do we have the strength to
do that now?

#### 16 ####
Now I hear Bartholomew,
the one who brought back
Marguerite, has started
moving around out in the
open. I'm certain Shakhan
is preparing a large army.

#### 17 ####
Shakhan may be coming
here soon...

#### 18 ####
 ... 

#### 19 ####
What's gonna happen to us
if he captures this area?

#### 20 ####
Will everyone be killed?

#### 21 ####
I seriously doubt that.{wait:1E}
Even he won't want to risk
provoking any kind of
outrage with the citizens.{enter}
Especially in this
situation, he will
definitely want to avoid
putting himself in a
compromising situation.

#### 22 ####
We should set up a hiding
place just in case...

#### 23 ####
Maybe there...

#### 24 ####
Sigurd
"I went to the tool shop
to borrow a table.{enter}
The owner said...
'if we need anything for
the young master, just
ask for it.'"

#### 25 ####
Bart
"I'm grateful."

#### 26 ####
Bart
"When I was a kid, {wait:1E}I
borrowed stuff from there
and got in big trouble."

#### 27 ####
Fei
"Borrowed...{wait:1E}
What did you take?

#### 28 ####
Bart
"A toy boat.{wait:1E}
...I think that's what
it was.{enter}
I put fireworks in it and
let it float on the
cathedral's lake. I always
used to play 'navy'."

#### 29 ####
Bart
"I'm not sure, but I
think I pretended the
lake was the open sea...{enter}
...and I was the fleet
commander."

#### 30 ####
Bart
"Anyway...forget those
old stories.{wait:1E}
We should get started."

#### 31 ####
Bart
"First...{wait:1E}
Gebler is the
big problem."

#### 32 ####
Citan
"Yes, Ramsus is headed
towards achieving his
goals.{enter}
That he is now the
commander of Gebler
is proof of that.{enter}
A normal man{wait:0A} could not
progress so quickly
through that country's
organization.{enter}
And now he is presently
located here in Ignas."

#### 33 ####
Citan
"Frankly, the situation
is not very favorable.{enter}
We need to somehow find
a weak spot and attack
it with all our might."

#### 34 ####
Bart
"First, let's just
concentrate on Shakhan.{enter}
Once he's out of the way
and Aveh is safe again,
we can think about how
to deal with Gebler."

#### 35 ####
Bart
"With our present strength
we should be able to hold
off the royal guard forces.{enter}
The problem is how to deal
with Gebler in the mean
time...{enter}
They will most likely move
at Shakhan's request.
They're not just gonna sit
by and watch quietly."

#### 36 ####
Citan
"...May I have a
look there please?"

#### 37 ####
Citan
"In short, we want Gebler
to leave for a while...{enter}
At least until we are able
to take back the Royal
Capital, Bledavik."

#### 38 ####
Sigurd
"But the problem is...{enter}
will attacking the border
guards be enough to set
the center in motion?"

#### 39 ####
Citan
"To be sure then, Nisan
will just have to appear
to align with Kislev.{enter}
If they see it that way,
they will certainly make
a move."

#### 40 ####
Bart
"You're saying that you
intend to use Nisan as
bait?"

#### 41 ####
Fei
"Doc!?"

#### 42 ####
Sigurd
"Shakhan is very
sensitive to Nisan's
and Kislev's actions.{enter}
If Nisan starts moving
he will probably leave
it up to Gebler, but..."

#### 43 ####
Citan
"Of course I do not
wish to do that from
the beginning.{enter}
But looking at the
situation, we have to
be willing to go that
far."

#### 44 ####
Hmm...

#### 45 ####
Bart
"First, we infiltrate
into the capital.{enter}
To take out Shakhan,
we'll have to meet
up with our agents
already in the city."

#### 46 ####
Citan
"We are forgetting
one thing...{enter}
The front line units
along Kislev's border."

#### 47 ####
Bart
"...!"

#### 48 ####
Bart
"Damn...{wait:1E}
That puts everything
in jeopardy!"

#### 49 ####
Citan
"Do not feel so down.{enter}
I simply wanted you
to see the current 
distribution of force
in the area.{enter}
Even in the worst case
that they do come, it
will not be such a great
problem."

#### 50 ####
Bart
"What do you mean?"

#### 51 ####
Citan
"I have some additional
information about Aveh's
border fleet.{enter}
The former Aveh supreme
commander was transferred
there.{enter}
Not really transferred,{wait:1E}
more like {wait:1E}demoted...{wait:1E}
His name is Vanderkaum."

#### 52 ####
Sigurd
"Vanderkaum..."

#### 53 ####
Sigurd
"You don't mean the
Vanderkaum that was
in Jugend?"

#### 54 ####
Citan
"The very same."

#### 55 ####
Citan
"Young one, he has not been
able to adapt to the change
in tactics...{enter}
particularly following the
introduction of Gears...{enter}
He is a man who will never
stray from his dependence
on large naval guns."

#### 56 ####
Bart
"You mean, he's stubborn.{enter}
He is all size and no
real military power.
An excellent target for
pirates."

#### 57 ####
Maison
"Young master!{wait:1E}
This is not going to
be an act of piracy!"

#### 58 ####
Bart
"Just kidding."

#### 59 ####
Citan
"Actually, the number of
Gears assigned to the fleet
seems to have been reduced."

#### 60 ####
Citan
"Even with that...{wait:1E}
how gallant of him to
be so self-righteous."

#### 61 ####
Bart
"Is he that much of
a muscle head? It'll
be fun taunting him."

#### 62 ####
Maison
"Young master!"

#### 63 ####
Bart
"I know! I know!{enter}
Anyway, Citan, do you
think he can strike
our Gear forces?"

#### 64 ####
Citan
"It is not a problem.{enter}
Even with Vanderkaum, we
have enough forces left
to pull off the feint.{enter}
However, it would not be
wise to underestimate our
opponents."

#### 65 ####
Fei
"Me...!?"

#### 66 ####
Sigurd
"Hold on now!{wait:1E}
There's no reason to
involve you all in this!"

#### 67 ####
Fei
"...I'll do it.{enter}
Yes, let me do it.
When do we leave?"

#### 68 ####
Bart
"...Are you sure?"

#### 69 ####
Fei
"We've come this far...
Hey, we're friends to
the end, now!"

#### 70 ####
Citan
"Speed is everything.
We should do this as
soon as possible."

#### 71 ####
Bart
"Alright, tomorrow!"

#### 72 ####
Sigurd
"I am truly grateful...{wait:1E}
Fei...{wait:1E}
Citan."

#### 73 ####
Bart
"Yeah!"

#### 74 ####
Bart
"There's no way we
can lose!{wait:1E} No one
will die in vain!"

#### 75 ####
Maison
"Well put,
young master!"

#### 76 ####
Margie
"You okay?{wait:1E}
Sister, are you wounded?"

#### 77 ####
Sister Agnes
"I'm fine. {wait:1E}
Marguerite and Bartholomew,
I'm sorry..."

#### 78 ####
Sigurd
"I took some troops and
searched the area, but I
couldn't find anyone."

#### 79 ####
Bart
"Really?"

#### 80 ####
Sister Agnes
"Earlier, {wait:1E}
after everyone came out..."

#### 81 ####
Sister Agnes
"Over half of the
residents have fled
from Nisan.{enter}
After that, Shakhan's
position in the country
was compromised so...{enter}
he didn't care about
reputations anymore and
attacked this land."

#### 82 ####
Citan
"I see. {wait:1E}
A last desperate plan to
reverse the situation..."

#### 83 ####
Bart
"Sister, I assume the
people remaining in the
town are...?"

#### 84 ####
Sister Agnes
"Yes. {wait:1E}
Hiding in the mausoleum."

#### 85 ####
Fei
"Mausoleum...?{wait:1E}
Hiding in a grave?"

#### 86 ####
Margie
"The Great Mothers and
Kings of Aveh of old
are revered there."

#### 87 ####
Bart
"It's not just some regular
grave or anything."

#### 88 ####
Sister Agnes
"Bartholomew,
about that..."

#### 89 ####
Sister Agnes
"Shakhan and
the Fatima Jasper...{enter}
He's after the Fatima
Treasure."

#### 90 ####
Citan
"Treasure...?{wait:1E} If he
wants the treasure what is
he doing attacking here..."

#### 91 ####
Bart
"Huh?{wait:1E} Ahh..."{wait:1E}

#### 92 ####
Bart
"Actually, the Fatima
Treasure is in the
mausoleum.{enter}
There was even father's
will there, but I didn't
tell anyone..."

#### 93 ####
Fei
"Treasure...{enter}
You mean that thing in the
picture scrolls you showed
me earlier in your base?"

#### 94 ####
Bart
"Yeah.{enter}
If you follow that legend,
you're supposed to get
your hands on some great
power."

#### 95 ####
Sigurd
"We must stop them
somehow."

#### 96 ####
Bart
"There's no problem.
The Jasper is..."

#### 97 ####
Sister Agnes
"They plan to use the
former Mother's retinas."

#### 98 ####
Bart
"Wha...{wait:1E}what!!"

#### 99 ####
Sister Agnes
"Remove the deceased
Mother's retina,{wait:1E} and
break the seal."

#### 100 ####
Bart
"Use the body of Margie's
mother?"

#### 101 ####
Margie
"Mom's...!!"

#### 102 ####
Sister Agnes
"I'm sorry. They used
innocent citizens and sect
followers as a shield.{enter}
There was no other way...{enter}
The truth we heard
previously from Margie
about the Jasper's true
form and how it's used.{enter}
They know now...{wait:1E}
I am truly sorry."

#### 103 ####
Bart
"Well...{wait:1E}
I don't blame you.
They had hostages!"

#### 104 ####
Citan
"Wait a moment.{wait:1E}
Retinas...what are you
speaking of?"

#### 105 ####
Bart
"The Fatima Jasper is the
topaz blue pupils of the
Fatima dynasty...{enter}
In other words...{wait:1E}
our retinal pattern.{enter}
The doors to the treasure
are opened by that...{wait:1E}
Or so it is said."

#### 106 ####
Bart
"However no one has ever
used it. It's not to be
used for minor conflicts.{enter}
The doors are to be opened
only when the kingdom is
truly in danger.{enter}
So neither I, {wait:1E}
nor my father, {wait:1E}
nor grandfather,{enter}
nor my great grandfather
have ever used it."

#### 107 ####
Citan
"So, that {wait:1E}is the true
form of the Jasper..."

#### 108 ####
Bart
"Damn!"

#### 109 ####
Bart
"That old coot, {wait:1E}he wants to
profane a holy person's
corpse? That's unthinkable!"

#### 110 ####
Citan
"It is a closely guarded
secret but the 'Ethos'
people are not holy men.{enter}
They simply supervise."

#### 111 ####
Fei
"Yes, of course they
wouldn't feel anything!{enter}
Let's go Bart!{wait:1E}
Before the mausoleum is
trashed."

#### 112 ####
Bart
"Alright!"

#### 113 ####
Sigurd
"Young master!{wait:1E}
I have a proposal."

#### 114 ####
Bart
"What is it Sig?"

#### 115 ####
Sigurd
"Currently Aveh is in
confusion with Shakhan
running amok.{enter}
It should be very easy
to bring down the center
with no Gebler units
around.{enter}
It'll be the best time to
make our return to the
capital."

#### 116 ####
Citan
"That is a good idea.{enter}
Shakhan is most likely
thinking of the Fatima
Jasper as his last card.{enter}
While we prevent the young
one from handing over the
treasure to Shakhan...{enter}
a separate force will take
back the capital.
Then he will have nowhere
else to go."

#### 117 ####
Bart
"I got it...{wait:1E}
Sounds good.{enter}
We can pay everything
back in one shot!"

#### 118 ####
    Elly
    Citan
    Billy
    Rico
    Maria
    {name:07:チュチュ}

#### 119 ####
Elly
"Fine, I'll go."

#### 120 ####
Citan
"If possible, I would like
to return to the capital
with Sigurd.{enter}
Two former Solarians will
dethrone the 'Ethos'...
How very ironic."

#### 121 ####
Billy
"I'll go."

#### 122 ####
Rico
"Leave it to me."

#### 123 ####
Maria
"I will help out."

#### 124 ####
{name:07:チュチュ}
"There's no choice 
but for me chu go!"

#### 125 ####
    Elly
    Billy
    Rico
    Maria
    {name:07:チュチュ}

#### 126 ####
Elly
"I'll go."

#### 127 ####
Billy
"I'll go."

#### 128 ####
Rico
"Leave it to me."

#### 129 ####
Maria
"I will help out."

#### 130 ####
{name:07:チュチュ}
"There's no choice
but for me chu go!"

#### 4 ####
Bart
"Alright! That decides it!{enter}
Everyone else cooperate
with Sig!"

#### 131 ####
Margie
"Hold on.{wait:1E}
I'm going too!"

#### 5 ####
Bart
"Huh?{wait:1E}
You don't have to...{wait:1E}
Oh, yeah.{enter}
Sorry Margie.
Come along with us."

#### 6 ####
Bart
"Alright I'm counting
on all of you!{enter}
He's a dead man the
next time I see him!"
