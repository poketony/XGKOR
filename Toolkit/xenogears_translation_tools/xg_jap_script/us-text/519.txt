#### 1 ####
Solaris' 'Mobile Surface
Supremacy Weapon' invaded
the area with great force{wait:05}...
Shevat and Nisan's standard
Gear battalions were no
match against it.{wait:2D}
 
It was only a matter of
time before the Solaris
Mobile Weapon arrived in
Nisan.{enter}
After we pushed back the
Solarian Gear units, we
headed for Nortune{wait:05}...{wait:05}
to the Kislev capital's
administrative district.{wait:0F}
 
We went there to obtain
our one and only means
of standing up against
the Mobile Weapon.

#### 2 ####
The Solaris Mobile Weapon
was destroyed{wait:05}...{wait:05}which
brought a sigh of relief
to the continent of Ignas.{wait:2D}
 
Peace was signed and after
some 500 years of division,
the land of Ignas once
again became united.

#### 3 ####
Excitement spread throughout
Aveh, Nisan, Kislev, Shevat{wait:05}...{wait:05}

#### 4 ####
The sky shimmered as if to
celebrate. By the hands of
Elly, Citan, Taura and
Emeralda, the nanomachines
had been dispersed into
the atmosphere.

#### 5 ####
That was when disaster struck.
{wait:05}...{wait:05}Our songs of victory were
replaced by the sounds of
total pandemonium{wait:05}...{wait:05}

#### 6 ####
In the beginning we had no
idea what had transpired.
We{wait:05}...{wait:05}witnessed unexplicable
phenomena.
People from all parts of
the globe began to mutate
into abnormal forms.

#### 7 ####
It seemed to be triggered
when the nanomachines
removed the -Limiter- seal
that was placed on humankind
by Krelian in the past...{wait:1E}
 
...{wait:05}The 'human' form with its
innate abilities released.

#### 8 ####
That's when I remembered
what Hammer had said back
in Solaris.{wait:1E}
 
His words were{wait:05}...{wait:05}
 "What{wait:00} becomes{wait:00} of{wait:00} the{wait:00}
 normal{wait:00} humans{wait:00}...{wait:05}?"

#### 9 ####
After that, we went from place
to place, destroying all the
Soylent System facilities
located on the surface of the
earth and freed the people
held at each of the locations.{wait:0F}
 
All the people that had been
mutated were taken in by Nisan
where they received treatment.

#### 10 ####
Those who had mutated only
mildly were treated with
Taura's nanomachines,
which reconstructed and
revived them.
 
They were able to return
back to their normal
bodies.{enter}
 
Unfortunately, there were some
that had such accelerated
symptoms that their treatment
was not as promising{wait:05}...

#### 11 ####
Trying to bring them back
to a form that resembled
a human was the best that
could be done.{wait:2D}
 
However,{wait:05} mysteriously,
they no longer fought each
other for survival as they
did when they were held by
the Soylent System.

#### 12 ####
Of course, their recovery
from the physical pain of
the mutation may have
played a factor,{wait:05} but it
wasn't only that{wait:05}...{wait:1E}
 
The majority of the people
received by Nisan were those
that had been admonished by
Elly and had regained their
humanity.

#### 13 ####
Between her work in destroying
the Soylent System facilities,
Elly also went around and
nursed the people in Nisan.{wait:1E}
 
She aided the bodies of the
mutated and lent an ear to
those who had no other place
to go for help{wait:05}...{wait:05}

#### 14 ####
She was the very image of the
woman who created Nisan{wait:05}...{wait:0F}
 
  'Mother Sophia'{wait:05}...{wait:2D}
 
It became rumored that{wait:05} Elly
was a reincarnation or a
second advent of Sophia.

#### 15 ####
Go to Nisan and you will
receive salvation{wait:05}...{wait:1E}
 
The news{wait:05} seemed to spread
further about and people
came from all over to be
saved, both physically
and spiritually.{enter}
 
Free from the supervision
of Solaris, the surface
dwellers began to unite
in one place.

#### 16 ####
Although the initial impact
of being released from the
-Limiter- seal caused some
momentary chaos, everything
slowly began to settle down.{enter}
We then began to search for
the 'Anima Relics'{wait:05}...{wait:05}
the catalyst to transform
Gears into Omnigears.{wait:1E}
 
In the past, ten Relics had
been recovered{wait:05}...{wait:0F}
It is said that about half
of those are in the hands
of the Ministry.

#### 17 ####
According to Zephyr,{wait:05} there
should be several more
Relics hidden in the land.{wait:1E}
 
We knew then that Solaris
would most certainly be
searching for them.{wait:05}
 
There was no way we could
allow Solaris to have them.{enter}
We visited the place where,{wait:05}
using archaic records,{wait:05} Zephyr
and her people had been able
to get clues on the where-
abouts of the Relics.{wait:0A}
 
Following the information
we obtained from there,{wait:05} we
headed towards the ruins of{wait:05}
what seemed to be{wait:05} an ancient
civilization.

#### 18 ####
Having fled from the Elements,
who tried to take the Relic to
be used as a power to fulfill
Ramsus' desires...{wait:0F}
 
we once again intiated our
search for information...{wait:1E}
 
on the whereabouts of the
last known Relic{wait:05}...

#### 19 ####
Having completed the alignment
of the first Anima Relic with
Billy, there was a remarkable
change in the appearance and
structure of Billy's Gear.{enter}
They were units that merged
with the inorganic{wait:05}...{wait:1E}
 
Of course we had no idea what
purpose these ancient Anima
Relics were created for.{wait:05}
But the fact that they played
some kind of role as weapons
was blatantly obvious.

#### 20 ####
Eventually their true
power will be released{wait:05}...{wait:0F}
And we cannot allow this
power to fall into the
hands of evil.{wait:1E}
 
In order to obtain the
final Relic,{wait:05} we headed for
a ruin that is believed to
be almost 10,000 years old.{wait:05}
...{wait:05}The remains of the first
civilization on our planet.

#### 21 ####
And{wait:05}...{wait:1E}
 
a reunion with an old
'friend' awaited us{wait:05}...

#### 22 ####
Hammer disappeared into
the chasm with a look of
satisfaction{wait:05}...{wait:1E}
 
Was he happy because he had
been able to attain it{wait:05}...?{wait:0F}
'His brief moment of power'{wait:05}...{enter}
Hammer's smile{wait:05}...{wait:0F}
Was that the look of joy from
attaining power{wait:05}...?{wait:0F}
Or was it the look of relief
from the pain that was brought
upon him by his mutation{wait:05}...?

#### 23 ####
Ultimately,{wait:05} we had no other
choice but to defeat our{wait:05}
'friend',{wait:05} Hammer,{wait:05} for the
sake of our own survival{wait:05}...{wait:2D}
 
Was there any other way
around it{wait:05}...?{wait:0F}
I've never felt that fighting
was so futile, until now{wait:05}...

#### 24 ####
Elly cried continuously{wait:05}...{wait:1E}
She hated herself for not
having the power to be able
to do anything to help him.{wait:1E}
 
When I saw her like that,
I couldn't help thinking{wait:05}...{wait:0F}
I can no longer allow her
to fight like this{wait:05}...{enter}
We returned to Ignas{wait:05}...{wait:05}
feeling that this had
become much more than
we could bear{wait:05}...

#### 25 ####
I was powerless{wait:05}...{wait:2D}
 
All I could do was stand
by and watch as they took
Elly away from me{wait:05}...{wait:3C}
 
I{wait:05}...{wait:0F}am powerless{wait:05}...

#### 26 ####
Wiseman
"What are you
doing there?"

#### 27 ####
Fei
"Oh, it's you{wait:05}...{wait:05}
I{wait:05}...{wait:05}I wasn't able to beat
Grahf{wait:05}...{wait:0F}{enter}
I didn't stand a chance
against him{wait:05}...{wait:05}
It was obvious from the
start."

#### 28 ####
Fei
"It was impossible to try
to defeat a monster machine
like that to begin with{wait:05}...{enter}
And{wait:05}...{wait:05}Elly{wait:05}...{wait:05}
Why was she so damn
foolish{wait:05}...?"

#### 29 ####
Fei
"I implicitly told her
not to come{wait:05}...{wait:0F}
I told her to run away{wait:05}...{enter}
She had to have known it
was a trap."

#### 30 ####
Wiseman
"...{wait:05}Hmm{wait:05}..."

#### 31 ####
Wiseman
"Yes, you won't be able to
defeat him like that{wait:05}...{enter}
As long as you continue
fighting with that kind
of an attitude, that is."

#### 32 ####
Fei
"{wait:05}...{wait:05}?{wait:05}"

#### 33 ####
Wiseman
"The reason you lost and
that young lady was taken{wait:05}
was because of your pride.{enter}
Weren't you depending far
too much on the power of
your machine?{enter}
...{wait:05}Not to mention that new{wait:05}
'Id Power'{wait:05} you're now able
to control!{enter}
What is Grahf's source of
power?{wait:0F} His machine?{wait:0F} His
technique?{wait:0F} His experience?{enter}
I do not think so{wait:05}...{wait:2D}
It is his{wait:05} feelings.{enter}
His heart,{wait:05} his feelings,{wait:05}
are dominated by his
resentment and his hatred
of this world.{enter}
That hatred is his source
of power.{wait:0F} Your feelings
weren't focused enough to
fight off Grahf.{enter}
That is why you could not
win.{wait:0F} Your feelings must be
in the right place.{wait:0F}
That{wait:0F} is strength."

#### 34 ####
Wiseman
"I'm not surprised
you lost{wait:05}...{enter}
...{wait:05}seeing as you do
not understand the
true meaning of
strength{wait:05}..."

#### 35 ####
Fei
"Wiseman{wait:05}...{wait:05}"

#### 36 ####
Wiseman
"That young lady{wait:05}...{wait:05}{enter}
The only thing in her heart
was her desire to save you
all.{wait:0A} She set aside her fear
and piloted that machine."

#### 37 ####
Wiseman
"It was because she had
such strong feelings that
you are all still alive{wait:05}...{enter}
That is what I think.{wait:0F}
Of course you have been
defeated.{wait:0F} However, that
doesn't mean it's over."

#### 38 ####
Wiseman
"How do you plan
on responding to
her feelings?{enter}
It is now your
turn to save her{wait:2D}
...{wait:05}is it not?"

#### 39 ####
Fei
"{wait:05}...{wait:05}"

#### 40 ####
Wiseman
"Well, what are
you going to do?{wait:2D}
...{wait:05}Fei{wait:05}..."

#### 41 ####
Fei
"I,{wait:05} errh{wait:05}...{wait:0F}
I'm going to{wait:05}...{wait:05}"

#### 42 ####
In order to save Elly,
We began to search
desperately for her
whereabouts...{wait:1E}
 
And{wait:05} two weeks later,
we found her.{enter}
Using the data obtained
from Razael and his own
nanomachine technology,{wait:05}
Krelian had begun the
construction of god's ark,{wait:05}
'Merkava'.
Its completion was imminent.{wait:2D}
 
To prevent its activation,{wait:05}
and to rescue Elly{wait:05}...{wait:05}
we headed for{wait:05} Merkava!

#### 43 ####
Fei
"You again{wait:05}...?{wait:1E}
Are you girls thinking
of going in there too?"

#### 44 ####
Dominia
"Don't get any wrong
ideas there.{wait:0A} We are here
to help our Commander.{enter}
Miang and Krelian have been
manipulating his emotions
for the sole purpose of
eliminating the Emperor.{enter}
We simply want to free the
commander from those bonds
so that he may be saved!{enter}
It's neither for the sake
of the world{wait:05}...{wait:0F}
nor for the sake of your
girlfriend, Elhaym!"

#### 45 ####
Dominia
"We have no intentions of
fighting on the same side
as you!"

#### 46 ####
Fei
"{wait:05}...{wait:05}Fine.{enter}
You have your own
battles to fight,{wait:05}
and we have ours{wait:05}...{wait:05}
Let's leave it at that."

#### 47 ####
Fei
"But{wait:05}...{wait:05}if things get out
of hand, you head back.{wait:0F}
We'll handle it."

#### 48 ####
Dominia
"Hmph{wait:05}...{wait:0F}
We'll make you eat those
words{wait:05}...{wait:05} You wait and see!"

#### 49 ####
We entered inside of Merkava
and,{wait:05} while fighting back
units of weapons that self-
regenerated through the use
of nanomachines,{wait:05} we headed
for the central core{wait:05}...{wait:05}
 
And then{wait:05}...{wait:05}
 
once again,{wait:05}
Ramsus appeared before us.

#### 50 ####
God{wait:05}...{wait:05}the inter-planetary
invasion weapon -Deus-{wait:05}...{wait:05}
had awakened and its ark,
 
Merkava
 
was activated.

#### 51 ####
Deus began to absorb,{wait:05}
one after the other,{wait:05}
the mutated people,{wait:05}
destined to be its parts{wait:05}...{wait:2D}
 
While the non-mutated,{wait:05}
would eventually,{wait:05}
only become a threat to it.{wait:05}
To exterminate us
and our civilization{wait:05}...{wait:1E}
 
it set into action.

#### 52 ####
The planet's surface
was devastated{wait:05}...{wait:05}
 
{wait:05}...{wait:05}by Merkava{wait:05}
and the weapons born
from out of it,{wait:05} called{wait:05}...{wait:2D}
 
'the -{wait:05}Seraph{wait:05}- angels'.

#### 53 ####
While pursuing
the newly awakened Deus,{wait:0F}
we chanced upon Fei,{wait:05}
whose whereabouts
had hitherto been lost{wait:05}...{wait:2D}
 
Along with his Gear,{wait:05}
{name:0B:¥ô¥§¥ë¥È©`¥ë}{wait:05}...{wait:0F}
 
Discovered together{wait:05}
at the place where{wait:05} 'Merkava'{wait:05}
was originally located{wait:05}...

#### 54 ####
We were overjoyed by
Fei's return{wait:05}...{wait:05}but{wait:0F}
it was short lived{wait:05}...{wait:2D}
 
For some unknown reason{wait:05}...{wait:0F}
Fei was found{wait:05} in a state of{wait:0A}
suspended animation.{wait:3C}
 
He did not regain
consciousness.

#### 55 ####
The people of Shevat,{wait:05}
and we ourselves,{wait:05}
feared a relapse of{wait:05}
Fei's,{wait:0A} no{wait:05}...{wait:0A}
Id's{wait:05} power{wait:05}...{wait:0F}
and had no choice
but to put Fei into{wait:05}...{wait:3C}
 
'Carbonite Freeze'.

#### 56 ####
Citan
"{wait:05}...{wait:05}Your Majesty.{wait:1E}
Why do the people of
Shevat fear Fei so much?{enter}
Even if Grahf and Id's
power are comparable{wait:05}..."

#### 57 ####
Zephyr
"{wait:05}...{wait:1E}
It is not that
we fear him."

#### 58 ####
Zephyr
"We fear the error we
ourselves committed.{enter}
And now we are simply
trying to put a lid
on it{wait:05}..."

#### 59 ####
Citan
"The error that you
yourselves committed?"

#### 60 ####
Zephyr
"Shevat instigated a battle
500 years ago to gain our
independence from Solaris.{enter}
However,{wait:05} we became overcome
with the lust for power{wait:05}...{enter}
Fearing the war-torn
people's will would no
longer be with Shevat, but
with the Nisan Mother{wait:05}...{enter}
and that the people would
assemble under Sophia{wait:05}...{enter}
...{wait:05}the Council of Elders
of Shevat back then,{wait:05} made
a deal with Solaris."

#### 61 ####
Citan
"A deal?"

#### 62 ####
Zephyr
"Yes{wait:05}..."

#### 63 ####
Zephyr
"At the time, Solaris{wait:05}...{wait:05}
or the Gazel Ministry to
be exact{wait:05}...{enter}
...{wait:05}were at odds with a
woman who held the real
power behind the scenes."

#### 64 ####
Citan
"{wait:05}...{wait:05}Would that happen
to have been Miang?"

#### 65 ####
Zephyr
"Most probably it was."

#### 66 ####
Fearing the increasing power
of the masses assembling in
Nisan,{wait:05} the Gazel Ministry
schemed to hand over to us
their antagonist,{wait:05} Miang,{wait:05} and
promised a division of the
rulership over the earth's
surface.{enter}
 
But in exchange{wait:05}...{wait:2D}
 
We had to give them the rebel
army that had assembled in
Nisan{wait:05} and also their patron,{wait:05}
Sophia{wait:05}...

#### 67 ####
Zephyr
"The leaders of Shevat
accepted{wait:05}...{enter}
...{wait:05}and it was decided that
Nisan would be the location
of the final decisive
battle with Solaris."

#### 68 ####
Zephyr
"Shevat did not participate
in that battle{wait:05}...{enter}
Thwarted by the awesome
numbers of the Solarian
army,{wait:05} and with their path
of retreat cut off{wait:05}...{enter}
...{wait:05}the Nisan rebel army
ran out of options{wait:05} and
was destroyed{wait:05}...{enter}
Caught up in the middle
of all this was Lacan,{wait:05}
Bart's ancestor Roni,{wait:0A}
myself{wait:0A}...{wait:2D} and 'Krelian'."

#### 69 ####
Citan
"You were also there?"

#### 70 ####
Zephyr
"Yes{wait:05}...{wait:1E}
Surrounded on all sides{wait:05}...{wait:05}
we were prepared to die.{enter}
And then,{wait:05} the rebel
forces' flagship appeared
with Sophia on board.{enter}
She sacrificed herself{wait:05}
so as to create a path
for our retreat{wait:05}...{enter}
Sophia's ship headed
straight for the enemy's
main ship on a suicide
attack."

#### 71 ####
Zephyr
"Thanks to Sophia's
sacrifice,{wait:05} we were
able to survive.{enter}
However,{wait:05} her death
forever changed the
fate of two men{wait:05}..."

#### 72 ####
Krelian,{wait:05} who followed closely
under her as the leader of the
Nisan sect's militia,{wait:05} completely
lost faith after calling out to
a god that would not respond.{wait:1E}
 
    "I will create god
    with my own hands!"{wait:3C}
 
{wait:05}...{wait:05}were the last words he
uttered{wait:05} before he disappeared.

#### 73 ####
And Lacan{wait:05}...{wait:1E}
 
He resented himself for
not having the power
to do anything while she
died in front of him{wait:05}...{wait:2D}
 
{wait:05}...{wait:05}So he began to search
for the 'Legendary Power'.

#### 74 ####
Citan
"Legendary Power?"

#### 75 ####
Zephyr
"God's resting place, 
'Mahanon'{wait:05}...{wait:1E} The source of
divine wisdom, 'Razael'{wait:05}...{enter}
And the 'Anima Relics'
which were created by
that very wisdom{wait:05}...{enter}
Besides these{wait:05}...{wait:0F}
there is one more
legend."

#### 76 ####
Citan
"And that is?"

#### 77 ####
Zephyr
"'Zohar'{wait:05}..."

#### 78 ####
Citan
"Zohar!?{wait:1E}
That has the same name as
the {wait:0A}'Zohar Modifier'{wait:0A}...{enter}
...{wait:05}the power reactor that
Miang spoke of,{wait:05} saying it
was the infinite energy
source of god{wait:05} -Deus-{wait:05}...{enter}
What she claimed is also
the source of our Ether
powers {wait:05}and the driving
force of all our Gears."

#### 79 ####
Zephyr
"It would have to be one
and the same thing{wait:05}...{enter}
It is the place that
contains the ultimate
source of this world's
power.{enter}
It is said that only he
who has the correct
destiny would be able to
discover its location{wait:05}..."

#### 80 ####
Zephyr
"Losing all faith in
humanity,{wait:05} Lacan sought
after its power{wait:05}...{enter}
Lacan became Grahf{wait:05}...{wait:0F}
and the world collapsed{wait:05}...{enter}
This tragedy happened
because of the people's
lust for power{wait:05}...{enter}
I must take part of the
responsibility for not
having been able to stop
it{wait:05}...{enter}
And now,{wait:05} Fei{wait:05}...{wait:05}
the one who has the same
power as Grahf{wait:05}...{enter}
We just wanted to seal
up that dreadful power
that arose from our own
sinful deeds{wait:05}..."

#### 81 ####
Grahf,{wait:05} the man once known
as Lacan,{wait:05} sought after
the 'Power of Zohar'{wait:05}...{wait:2D}
 
  The one who has the same
  power as Grahf{wait:05}...Fei{wait:05}...{wait:3C}
 
I had this premonition
that Fei too{wait:05} would awaken
and seek out that power.{wait:3C}
 
And that presentiment{wait:05}
became reality.

#### 82 ####
He broke through his
carbonite encasing...{wait:0F}
 
'Id'{wait:05}...{wait:1E}Fei took his
Gear {name:0B:¥ô¥§¥ë¥È©`¥ë} and went
in search of Zohar.{wait:3C}
 
We followed Fei's trail.{wait:2D}
 
Eventually, we arrived at
the location where Zohar
had fallen to earth{wait:05}...{wait:05}
so very long ago{wait:05}...

#### 83 ####
Nothing could have prepared
us for what we were about
to see there{wait:05}...

#### 84 ####
We set out to silence god's
ark,{wait:05} 'Merkava',{wait:05} which was
the epitome of offensive
and defensive power{wait:05}...{wait:05}
and then storm inside it{wait:05}...{wait:2D}
 
We initiated the operation
to destroy 'Zohar'.

#### 85 ####
At that time, the earth
quaked and shook.{wait:0F} And,{wait:05}
from the location where
the Merkava crashed,{wait:0F} a
giant object appeared.{enter}
 
It was Deus' final form.{wait:2D}
 
The Merkava was merely
its vessel.{wait:0F}
Deus evolved through
the use of Krelian's
nanomachines into a
planetary scale weapon
and began terraforming.

#### 86 ####
It was attempting to
convert this entire
planet into a weapon...
 
We retreated back to the
base at the snow plains
to form a new strategy...
 
We decided to go back into
Deus. Time was running out
for us.
