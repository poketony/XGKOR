Elly
"Um...Where is Billy?
I'd like to thank him..."

#### 2 ####
Citan
"Then..."

#### 3 ####
Citan
"Elly, that is not
true. You cannot resist
being hypnotized.{enter}
More importantly,
you saved Fei.{enter}
Fei could not have
been protected from
Kahr without you.
Is that not correct?"

#### 4 ####
Citan
"Well, we do not want to 
disturb his recovery.
So, shall we go now?{enter}
It may take a little 
longer to finish 
treating Fei."

#### 5 ####
Citan
"I agree.
Fei will feel at ease
that way. Please let us{enter}
know when you finish
treating Fei.
We will leave the rest
up to you."

#### 6 ####
Citan
"Did Fei regain 
consciousness?"

#### 7 ####
Citan
"I am sorry to have
bothered you."

#### 8 ####
Citan
"We are in Billy's debt.
We should go thank him."

#### 9 ####
Citan
"First of all, let us move
Fei to the Yggdrasil.{enter}
It will not be too late to
go see Billy afterwards."

#### 10 ####
Citan
"Then..."

#### 11 ####
Citan
"Elly, that is not
true. You cannot resist
being hypnotized.{enter}
More importantly,
you saved Fei.{enter}
Fei could not have
been protected from
Kahr without you.
Is that not correct?"

#### 13 ####
Citan
"I agree.
Fei will feel at ease

#### 17 ####

#### 18 ####
Bart
"That means..."

#### 19 ####
Bart
"Elly, that's not true.
You can't resist being
hypnotized. You don't{enter}
need to feel guilty.
More importantly, you
saved Fei. You
protected him from{enter}
Ramsus.
Isn't that right?"

#### 20 ####
Bart
"Hey, we don't want to 
disturb his recovery.
Let's take a little walk.{enter}
It may take a little 
longer to finish 
treating Fei."

#### 21 ####
Bart
"Yeah, why don't you do 
that. I'm sure Fei'll be 
happy. {enter}
Well, call us when you're 
done with Fei. I'll leave 
the rest to you."

#### 22 ####
Bart
"By the way, did Fei
regain consciousness?"

#### 23 ####
Bart
"Thanks a lot!"

#### 24 ####
Bart
"Billy really helped
us a lot. We'd better
thank him for that."

#### 25 ####
Bart
"First, let's take Fei to 
the Yggdrasil. We can go 
thank him afterwards."

#### 26 ####
Rico
"Hmm, then..."

#### 27 ####
Rico
"At the time, you were
hypnotized. You couldn't
help it. Don't feel guilty.{enter}
He could've been killed
by Ramsus if you weren't 
there then."

#### 28 ####
Rico
"It may take a little
longer to finish his
treatment. Let's go{enter}
somewhere to kill time."

#### 29 ####
Rico
"Do what you need to do.{wait:14}
Let me know when you're 
finished with Fei."

#### 30 ####
Rico
"Is Fei better?"

#### 31 ####
Rico
"You must've put in 
a lot of time."

#### 32 ####
Rico
"...I want to thank Billy
at least."

#### 33 ####
Rico
"First of all, let's take
Fei to the Yggdrasil.
And we can go from there."

#### 34 ####
Elly
"Even if it was impossible 
to resist, the reason why 
I was hypnotized was {enter}
because I was off my guard.
I'm partly responsible for
what happened.{enter}
So I'd like to be by his
side till he's awake."

#### 35 ####
Elly
"Fei{wait:0A}...{wait:0A}
I'm sorry."

#### 36 ####
Elly
"{wait:0A}...{wait:0A}Will Fei ever 
regain consciousness?"

#### 37 ####
Elly
"{wait:0F}...{wait:0F}I'm sorry, Fei.
I caused the engine room
to lose control..."

#### 38 ####
Elly
"Thank you..."

#### 39 ####
Elly
"I...{wait:0F}would like to
stay a little while.{wait:0A}
Is it okay?"

#### 40 ####
Billy
"How is he?"

#### 41 ####
Billy
"All we can do is 
wait and see."

#### 42 ####
He is in stable condition.
His treatment is almost 
complete.

#### 43 ####
W, what's happening?{wait:0F}
Those men in black are
killing the 'Ethos'
people indiscriminately!

#### 44 ####
You seem to be better.
I'm glad. I'm really glad.

#### 45 ####
Has he recovered?
His treatment was a 
success, so there's no 
need to worry.

#### 46 ####
The patient hasn't regained
consciousness yet,
but we see no abnormality
with his brain.{enter}
The low water temperature
lowered his metabolism and
saved him.{enter}
One false step and he
could've suffered from
brain death.

#### 47 ####
Yes, don't worry.{wait:0F}
However, we need to conduct
more tests for a while.{enter}
After that, he can be
treated at your medical
facilities.

#### 48 ####
The reason why he hasn't
regained consciousness is
physical exhaustion.
He overworked himself. {enter}
It'll probably take him a
few more days, but don't
worry, he'll wake up.

#### 49 ####
Please, don't worry.
I did my job as a 
clergyman.

#### 50 ####
Hello, everyone.
His treatment is finished.

#### 51 ####
Unfortunately, the patient
hasn't regained
consciousness yet. But
there's no need to worry.{enter}
When he recovers physically,
he'll also regain
consciousness. You can
take him to your ship now.

#### 52 ####
Please don't worry.
I did my job as a 
clergyman.

#### 53 ####
Oh yes, brother Billy...{enter}
He went back to the
orphanage.
He was worried about the
children left behind.
