A reactor that cannot be
controlled by man is just
like a double-edged sword.
We will hurt even ourselves.

#### 2 ####
In the northern part of the
capital, in the industrial
block lies a relic from an
ancient civilization...
a giant 'reactor'.{enter}
That reactor produces power
beyond our ability to control.
It's something man will
never be able to wield...

#### 3 ####
It's become apparent that the
primary target in the attack
on the Empire was to bomb that
reactor in the industrial block.{enter}
If{wait:05} they had a direct hit on the
reactor{wait:05}...{wait:05}the entire capital
would've been turned to ashes.{enter}
It would've been a hell on
earth{wait:05} where no living thing
could exist."

#### 4 ####
There's been some
information that
suggests Aveh is doing
something suspicious.{enter}
This balance we've 
had with them isn't
going to last{wait:05}...

#### 5 ####
During the assault on the
Empire, it was said that
the new imperial Gear was
stolen from the D Block
area Gear dock{wait:05}...{enter}
According to the higher
ups, I accidentally heard
that it was the same Gear
that was stolen by that
commando unit.

#### 6 ####
Just a while ago I was
pretty active in the
Battling tournament.{enter}
Then those people from the
committee scouted me out.
Heh, it's good to be a
soldier.

#### 7 ####
My Gear was primarily
customized for ground
combat and they used
that to assign me to
the rescue unit.{enter}
Although I wasn't able
to fight in my Gear,
it's a pretty good
feeling knowing my job
is saving people.

#### 8 ####
For today's lecture we will
discuss the movement of
Gears on the world map.{enter}
I understand that most of
you are ex-Battlers and are
well acquainted with Gears,
but it should be no loss for
you to re-learn the basics.{enter}
First, the limits to the
area of movement of Gears...{wait:05}
It is impossible to walk
through dense forests in
a Gear!{enter}
Instead of being hasty, just
press the L2 and R2 buttons
simultaneously and you will
all get off your Gears.{enter}
Once you pass through the
forest, you may once again
get on your Gears! That is
all for this lecture...{wait:05}
Any questions?

#### 9 ####
{wait:05}...{wait:05}If there are no
questions, class is
dismissed.{wait:0F} Oh yes, I
forgot one thing...{enter}
This is common sense,{wait:05}
but movement over
water is not possible.

#### 10 ####
Whew,{wait:05} it was another
wonderful lecture today.
I'm even awed at myself.{enter}
{wait:05}...{wait:05}I'm sure looking
forward to tomorrow's 
lecture.

#### 11 ####
Hmm,{wait:05} I noticed you were all
diligently listening to my
lecture.{enter}
Now don't forget,{wait:0F} getting
on and off your Gears is
done by pressing the L2 and
R2 buttons simultaneously!!

#### 12 ####
Battler Soldier
"The lecture's about to begin.
Although it's short, it's such
a bother. Please don't talk
to me right now."

#### 13 ####
Battler Soldier
"The officer's lecture is
always the same{wait:05}...{wait:0F}It's
hard on us people who
have to listen to him.{enter}
Not just that,{wait:05} he keeps
adding to the rules,
regulations and control
of activities.{enter}
I wish I could go back to
my days as a Battler."

#### 14 ####
Amazon Soldier
"Shut up,{wait:05} I'm trying to
listen so quit talking
to me."

#### 15 ####
Amazon Soldier
"Argh,{wait:05} this sucks.{wait:0F} He
thinks it's a lecture{wait:05} but
all he does is say the
same thing everyday.{enter}
Compared to this, I was
fighting a lot more in my
Battling days.{enter}
Now that was living.
Maybe I should quit the
military..."

#### 16 ####
Army Cook
"Patriotism is a necessary
component to drafting many
young soldiers.{enter}
But because of that, we get
some young ones that over do
it. By the time that happens,
it's usually too late{wait:05}...{wait:05}"

#### 17 ####
Army Cook
"I'm the cook for the
Imperial barracks.
I can get in trouble for
having you guys in here.{enter}
If you have no business
here, please leave.
Moreover, you aren't
even soldiers.{enter}
I thought that I told
them strictly not to
allow civilians in.{enter}
Man...what am I going
to do."

#### 18 ####
Argh!{wait:05} I failed{wait:05} again.{wait:0F}
Hmmm,{wait:05} there's just
something not right with
the special sauce.{enter}
Ether cuisine has a lot
of depth to it.

#### 19 ####
Failure is an important
step to my path to success!{wait:0F}
It's my dream to become
just like that first Ether
cook over in D Block.

#### 20 ####
{wait:05}...{wait:05}I volunteered so
that I could protect my
country{wait:05}...{wait:05} But this{wait:05}...{wait:05}
I didn't join for this.

#### 21 ####
I'm a new recruit for the
Kislev military. I just
graduated from the Imperial
officer school as an elite!{enter}
So, why did they put me in
A Block working under the
chief cook?
