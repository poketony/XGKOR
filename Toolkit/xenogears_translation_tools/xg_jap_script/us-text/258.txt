(Hyuga...{wait:0A}
I don't know why
you are here.{enter}
But if you try
anything funny...{wait:0A}
Do you understand?)

#### 2 ####
(I also left his land.
Since we just met, I do
not blame you for not
trusting me, but...)

#### 3 ####
Oh, young master!
It's unusual for you
to be alone.
It's already been fixed, 
so please don't worry.

#### 4 ####
What do you want to do?
{fast:FF}    View Gear from here
    View Gear from front
    Hear lowdown on Gear
    Nothing

#### 5 ####
This is {name:0B:任尼伙玄奈伙}.
Height 16.3 sharls
Base Weight 17.8 kahnns
Full Weight 22.7 kahnns
when fully equipped.{enter}
A well balanced Gear in
offensive, defensive,
and Ether abilities.{enter}
But it has some parts that
cannot be disassembled...
I guess you can call them
'blackboxes'...?{enter}
They don't cause problems
in maintenance, but they
just get on my mind every
time that I see them.

#### 6 ####
This is {name:0C:任尼伙玄奈伙2}.

#### 7 ####
This is {name:1A:未用幼失旦}.
It is Fei's Gear.{enter}
Height 19.8 sharls
Base Weight 18.9 kahnns
Full Weight 21.4 kahnns
when fully equipped.{enter}
{name:0C:任尼伙玄奈伙2} was
transformed after its
contact with Zohar.{enter}
Detailed specs cannot be
ascertained by the
measuring devices here.{enter}
But then again, I wonder
whether this Gear has a
limited ability to measure
at all?{enter}
It almost seems that this
Gear gets stronger and
stronger as Fei's mental
powers increase...{enter}
Anyhow, the engine seems
to have been left in there
from before, so it should
require fuel as before...{enter}
But it wouldn't surprise
me if this thing doesn't
actually need fuel anymore!

#### 8 ####
This is {name:0F:皮伉布件犯奴失},
our boss, the young
master's Gear.{enter}
Height 17.0 sharls
Base Weight 13.9 kahnns
Full Weight 18.6 kahnns
when fully equipped.{enter}
It is specially tuned for
desert battles. The power
of the Hover-thrusters in
the legs are especially
worthy of attention...{enter}
Oh, and the eyepatch and
feather decorations were
added later at the young
master's request.

#### 9 ####
We didn't know what to do
when young master said,{wait:0A}
"Destroy one sensor and
put an eyepatch over it
...without weakening the
ability to reconnoiter..."!

#### 10 ####
This is {name:17:禳丰╞韞犮竷‘瞕,
the young master's Gear...{enter}
Height 18.3 sharls
Base Weight 15.2 kahnns
Full Weight 19.1 kahnns
when fully equipped.{enter}
This is an Omnigear that
was left by Roni Fatima,
the ancestor of our young
master...{enter}
They say this Omnigear was
created by uniting that...
Anima Relic (or whatever it
is called...) and a machine.{enter}
But by the looks of it, this
frame also used to be some
kind of Gear before it was
transformed...{enter}
All exterior work and 60% of
the interior was changed to
unknown materials, but the
base was a regular machine.{enter}
So that means the basic
performance can be improved
by using different parts.{enter}
But then again, it moves by
spiritual power so such parts
may not influence its real
overall power that much.

#### 11 ####
This is {name:17:禳丰╞韞犮竷‘瞕,
the young master's Gear...{enter}
Height 18.3 sharls
Base Weight 15.2 kahnns
Full Weight 19.1 kahnns
when fully equipped.{enter}
It was created by two of
the sages of Shevat,
Balthasar and Melchior...{enter}
They made it using the data
on the Omnigear left by Roni
Fatima, an ancestor of the
young master, and the data
obtained from {name:1A:未用幼失旦}.{enter}
It is a combination of the
latest Gear technology and
nanotechnology. But the
performance is the same as
when it was an Omnigear.{enter}
Even when it was found
hidden in the underground
in Nisan, its basic weapon
equipment was the whip.{enter}
That must mean, the young
master's ancestors must've
used whips and rods too...
I guess it's in the blood,
huh!?

#### 12 ####
This is {name:0E:目奶丞母伙},
Doctor Citan Uzuki's Gear.{enter}
Height 16.9 sharls
Base Weight 14.0 kahnns
Full Weight 18.1 kahnns
when fully equipped.{enter}
The basic frame was
excavated at the same time
as the young master's Gear.{enter}
But its output was
proportionately too powerful
for the body, so it took a
long time to adjust it...{enter}
Actually many of my team
members were injured
because of it.{enter}
But doc solved the problem
so easily, and can control
it so well now...
It was just amazing.

#### 13 ####
This is {name:16:禳丰掍坏韞磪觱,
Doctor Citan Uzuki's Gear.{enter}
Height 18.6 sharls
Base Weight 17.2 kahnns
Full Weight 20.4 kahnns
when fully equipped.{enter}
It was created by two of
the sages of Shevat,
Balthasar and Melchior.{enter}
They used the data from the
Omnigear, Fenril, brought
from Solalis by the Doctor,
and Fei's {name:1A:未用幼失旦}.{enter}
It is a union of Gear and
nanotechnology. But the
performance is the same as
when it was an Omnigear.{enter}
The default equipment is
the sword...which seems
to be the doctor's weapon
of choice.

#### 14 ####
Want to rename this Gear?
{fast:FF}    Yes, I'd like to!
    No, not now thanks!

#### 15 ####
Citan
"Fei!
I was worried about you!"

#### 16 ####
Fei
"Doc..."

#### 17 ####
Welcome to the sand cruiser
"Yggdrasil". We apologize
for that earlier incident.

#### 18 ####
Maison
"I'm sure everyone has
already had the courtesy
to introduce themselves. {enter}
But allow me to introduce
the sand pirates' leader,
Master Bartholomew."

#### 19 ####
Maison
"By the way, may I ask,
young master, did you
apologize to Master Fei?" 

#### 20 ####
Bart
"What?  Uhh...yeah...{wait:0A}
I told him I was
'wrong'...{wait:0A} Right?"

#### 21 ####
...

#### 22 ####
Just telling someone you
were 'wrong' after the
event isn't going to solve
everything, young master.

#### 23 ####
First Mate
"I'm sorry I've delayed
introducing myself...{enter}
My name is "Sigurd", the
First Mate of this sand
cruiser.

#### 24 ####
Maison
"Well then, please let me
know if you need anything."

#### 25 ####
Bart
"...That's the situation...{wait:0A}
So now, forgive me, will
ya!?"

#### 26 ####
Sigurd
"Young master!
Stay out of mischief."

#### 27 ####
"Ouch ouch ouch!!
Don't pull my ears!"{clear:0F}

#### 28 ####
Citan
"Let us go and wait in our
cabin until we arrive...{enter}
It is well-made and
comfortable."

#### 29 ####
Fei
"..."

#### 30 ####
Citan
"What is wrong?
You look down."

#### 31 ####
Fei
"No...{wait:0A}
Well..."

#### 32 ####
Citan
"Something happened?"

#### 33 ####
Fei
"No, nothing."

#### 34 ####
Fei
"{slow:01}I...must go{wait:05}...!!

#### 35 ####
Citan
"You are in no condition
to participate...{wait:0A}
Let us take care of this!"

#### 36 ####
Billy
"Looks like it's time to
settle the score... But,
Fei should be resting."

#### 37 ####
Billy
"Looks like it's time to
settle the score... But,
Fei should be resting."

#### 38 ####
Citan
"Yes. {wait:0A}
I shall take Fei to the
infirmary.{enter}
Billy, please take care of
the rest of things."

#### 39 ####
Billy
"Please help us if you
can."

#### 40 ####
Fei!?

#### 41 ####
Fei
"Uh,{wait:14} doc..."

#### 42 ####
Citan
"Fei, 
feeling better already?"

#### 43 ####
Fei
"Yeah...{wait:14}
Probably..."

#### 44 ####
Elly
"I take my eyes off of you
for a second and this is
what you go and do...{enter}
What are you doing riding
a Gear when you're only
just recovering?"

#### 45 ####
Elly
"What are you doing riding
a Gear when you're only
just recovering?"

#### 46 ####
Billy
"Why are you up and about?
I thought you were only
just recovering?{enter}
You shouldn't be doing
that!"

#### 47 ####
Bart
"What are you moving around
for when you've only just
recovered?{enter}
Aren't sick people supposed
to rest in bed!!"

#### 48 ####
Rico
"Why are you moving around?
You've only just recovered!{wait:0A}
Get back to bed!!"

#### 49 ####
Fei
"I don't know what I'm
doing here myself...{enter}
I don't have a clear head,
yet..."

#### 50 ####
...

#### 51 ####
Uhhh...

#### 52 ####
Citan
"Fei!!{wait:0A}
You should not be
moving around yet!!"

#### 53 ####
Alkanshel located straight
ahead!!{wait:0A}
Prepare Gears for launch!!
