Citan
"That someone was
waiting for you{wait:05}...{enter}
That one thought was
all it took for you
to regain yourself{wait:05}...{enter}
You are a great man,{wait:14}
Sigurd{wait:05}..."

Citan
"So we are too late..."

#### 3 ####
Citan
"Nanomachines are
robots that are smaller
than human cells.{enter}
They are used to cure
diseases or wounds in
Solaris.{enter}
...She may be a colony
of nanomachines made
by an ancient, but
advanced technology."

#### 4 ####
Citan
"I am worried about what
Bishop Stone mentioned.{enter}
He said he needed her
 'to free humanity
 from its yoke'.{enter}
Perhaps some ancient
information on human
reconstruction is hidden
inside of her body...{enter}
Demihumans, such as Rico
and Hammer were born from
the results of the messing
around with D.N.A....{enter}
That was done by ancient
Solaris' in the hopes that
it would bring about the
restoration of mankind.{enter}
If Krelian is thinking of
trying the same thing with
improved nanotechnology...
that would be frightening."

#### 5 ####
Sigurd
"Why such a glum face?{enter}
Tomorrow is our first
return to your castle
in 12 years."

#### 6 ####
Sigurd
"You'll get used to it."

#### 7 ####
Sigurd
"Yes?"

#### 8 ####
Sigurd
"I was kidnapped by Solaris
and brainwashed for use as
a human guinea pig."

#### 9 ####
Sigurd
"But, even they couldn't
erase my desire to return
home.{enter}
Then, I remembered you and
Marguerite, not as the
royalty of our country but
as just normal children.{enter}
I don't care about
rebuilding a dynasty.{enter}
I want to regain this
kingdom because it
belongs to you...{wait:0A}
Because it's your home!"

#### 10 ####
Sigurd
"Yes.{enter}
For that, we must take
Shakhan down tomorrow.
Am I correct?"

#### 11 ####
Sigurd
"But first...{wait:0A}
I think you need
to take a bath!"

#### 12 ####
Sigurd
"You don't look
like a king at all!{enter}
You are facing the
enemy's leader...
so you must have a
noble appearance!"

#### 13 ####
Sigurd
"That is that,
this is this!"

#### 14 ####
Bart
"Returning to the castle...{enter}
After we get the royal
palace back, I guess I'm
going to be the king{wait:05}...{enter}
...{wait:05}I'm not very suited for
it,{wait:05} am I?"

#### 15 ####
Bart
"Listen,{wait:0A} Sig{wait:14}..."

#### 16 ####
Bart
"I guess it really...{wait:14}
doesn't matter who the
king is,{wait:0A} does it?{enter}
As long as it's a symbol
of hope, right?{wait:14}
It doesn't have to be me."

#### 17 ####
Bart
"Because it's my home?"

#### 18 ####
Bart
"...Right.
Then, let's do it!!"

#### 19 ####
Bart
"A bath!?"

#### 20 ####
Bart
"Hey, you just said it
didn't matter whether
I'm a king or not!!"

#### 21 ####
Bart
"Citan, so someone named
Krelian took the kid. So
what?{enter}
What the heck is a
nanomachine, anyway?"

#### 22 ####
Bart
"...Then, what's the prob?
It's good for people,
right?{enter}
It just irritates me that
it's all only for Solaris."

#### 23 ####
Billy
"Citan, so what happens
now that Krelian took the
child?{enter}
What is a nanomachine
anyway?"

#### 24 ####
Billy
"Even if it's only for the
people of Solaris...{enter}
What's wrong with making
people happy?"

#### 25 ####
Rico
"Citan, someone named
Krelian took the kid,
so what?{enter}
What is a nanomachine,
anyway?"

#### 26 ####
Rico
"...Then, what's the prob?
It's good for people,
right?{enter}
But it irritates me that
all of them are for
Solaris."
