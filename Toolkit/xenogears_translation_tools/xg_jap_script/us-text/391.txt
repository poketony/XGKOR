That is Lacan...
No, the dark one.
Grahf's second advent!{enter}
We must restrain and seal
him up otherwise we don't
know what may occur!

#### 2 ####
Zephyr
"Cease this at once!{enter}
May we at least wait for
Wiseman to return before
we make any resolutions?"

#### 3 ####
Although a tactician, why
do you place so much
importance on him?{enter}
I have been silent all this
time since Khan's death,
since he was directly
recruited by the Queen.{enter}
However, I question why you
would use such a person
whose principles lack any
understanding of sacrifice?

#### 4 ####
Zephyr
"Well, that is..."

#### 5 ####
You must look at reality!
The existence of that
power!

#### 6 ####
Bart
"Hold on, hold on.
What's this Grahf's
second advent?"

#### 7 ####
The Day of the Collapse
was brought upon by Grahf.
Grahf manipulated Diabolos
into destroying this world.{enter}
And that power within Id is
far too similar to Grahf's.
We cannot allow such a
hazard to be set free.{enter}
We ought to immediately
freeze him in carbonite.
Otherwise, expect the
worst at any moment...

#### 8 ####
Elly
"No...!
But isn't the present
Fei the real Fei?{enter}
If that's the case,
then why..."

#### 9 ####
But he is still far too
dangerous! Think about it.{enter}
He single-handedly
annihilated the Solaris
capital!{enter}
We can't set him free!

#### 10 ####
Jessie
"Not only that.{enter}
In the past, there were
countless other cities
that were destroyed by Id.{enter}
I don't know their
intentions, but Grahf
and Krelian were always
involved somehow.{enter}
And one of those incidents
was Elru.{enter}
It was Dominia's homeland.{enter}
Solaris' purging of the
rebelling city of Elru was
done through the use of Id.
To test his capabilities.{enter}
As a result, not only was
Elru taken down, all the
Solaris units present
were wiped out..."

#### 11 ####
Bart
"He's responsible for
the Ygg's...and our..."

#### 12 ####
Rico
"So he was the one who
killed my subordinates
in the sewers..."

#### 13 ####
Elly
"What's wrong with you all?
Aren't we supposed to be
his friends!?"

#### 14 ####
Citan
"It appears everyone else
is in agreement... The
risks are just too great."

#### 15 ####
Elly
"Citan!?
No...
That is terrible!"

#### 16 ####
Zephyr
"..."

#### 17 ####
It's decided then.
He will be scheduled for
carbon freezing, tomorrow.

#### 18 ####
That which the Gazel Ministry
of Solaris desperately seeks...
is the 12 Anima Relics created
by god's wisdom.{enter}
The merging of an Anima Relic
and a Gear can produce an 
Omnigear...{enter}
But, the subjects must be in
suitable synchronization or
else the transformation will
not occur.{enter}
Some of the Anima Relics have
been discovered, but there are
still more left undiscovered,
sleeping deep in the earth.{enter}
Even we have been devoting
much to the search...
but, to no avail...

#### 19 ####
The power of the Omnigears
was so great that they could
even hold back Diabolos'
collapse 500 years ago.{enter}
If any more of these fall
into the hands of the
enemy...{enter}
Our future and even those
of the land dwellers will
be...!!{enter}
I implore you, land dwellers!
We require your assistance.{enter}
Shevat must collect the
remaining Anima Relics,
by any means necessary...!

#### 20 ####
Hmhmm...{wait:14}
So the Anima Relics were
created by god's wisdom.{enter}
I wonder if that is
truly the case...

#### 21 ####
All in all, that unit was
meant to merge with
something inorganic.{enter}
That would be the proper
assumption...

#### 22 ####
It is foolish of humans
chu try chu depend on
such things...

#### 23 ####
Oh my, I've said chu much.{wait:14}
Forget what I said.

#### 24 ####
Uh, and, yeah...the relic,
relic...{wait:14} I wonder where the
little Anima Relic went...
