"What!?{wait:14}
Collecting combat data!?{enter}
Then, this war that's
lasted for hundreds of
years on the Ignas
continent...{enter}
It was just a farce 
plotted by Solaris!?"

Rico
"...I see...that's how
it was."

Billy
"The 'Ethos'...
supervised...?{enter}
The land dwellers...like
domestic animals...?{wait:1E}
Then I was..."

#### 6 ####
The Limiter restrains the
Lambs' abilities. But there
may be a way to remove it.{enter}
Taura Melchior, he used
to be one of the three 
sages of Shevat.{enter}
He must know a way to
remove the Limiter.

#### 7 ####
The scientists of Solaris
had bitter experiences in
the revolt by the Lambs
500 years ago. {enter}
So they decided to do
some work on the Lambs.{wait:14}
They inserted various
Limiters so that they would
never be able to revolt.{enter}
For the past 500 years,
Solaris controlled the
Lambs' consciousness,
behavior and all.{enter}
Naturally, Lambs don't
know anything about it.{wait:14}
That makes it even more
unforgivable!!{wait:14} Although
it's highly efficient...

#### 8 ####
This land is a testing
ground for Solaris.{wait:14}
Their objectives are
genetic engineering,
crossbreeding, and mind
control...{enter}
They want to collect data
for the newly created 
organisms and general 
combat data.{enter}
Lambs are mere livestock
to be raised for Solaris'
purposes.{wait:14}
The 'Ethos' was
established mainly to
control the Lambs.

#### 9 ####
It's not a farce.{wait:14}
To them, it's an important
simulation under strict
restrictions.{enter}
Creating appropriate
organisms that can align
themselves with the
'Anima Relics' is one of
their important objectives.{enter}
In any case, the Lambs will
continue to be Solaris'
guinea pigs unless someone
stops them.

#### 10 ####
They're not doing this
for fun, either.{wait:14}
It's an important
simulation.{enter}
Creating appropriate
organisms that can align
themselves with the
'Anima Relics' is one of
their important objectives.{enter}
In any case, the Lambs will
continue to be Solaris'
guinea pigs unless someone
stops them.

#### 11 ####
You land dwellers better
think seriously about it.{wait:14}
The Lambs'll continue to
be Solaris' guinea pigs
unless someone stops them.

#### 12 ####
The whereabouts of the three
sages, Melchior, Balthasar
and Gaspar have not been
known since the great war.{enter}
There's even a rumor that
they lost faith in humans
because of the tragedy in
Nisan.{enter}
Solaris' activities have
increased once again...{wait:14}
I wonder where they are
and what they're up to.

#### 13 ####
A man named Krelian was
the mastermind behind
the planting of the
Limiter in the Lambs.{enter}
He was originally a Lamb.
He learned molecular
engineering from the sage,
Melchior, personally.{enter}
But he misused it for
such a terrible act!{wait:14}
An unbelievable monster!
