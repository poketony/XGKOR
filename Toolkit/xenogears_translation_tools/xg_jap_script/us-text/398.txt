Fei
"I heard about it from
doc.
Id...{enter}
...Who would've ever
thought within me, lies
another me..."

#### 2 ####
Fei
"They say I'm the second
advent of Grahf.{enter}
The one who destroyed all
of this world...{enter}
It seems Grahf used to be
a land dweller named
Lacan..."

#### 3 ####
Fei
"Grahf called me the one
who would destroy god{enter}
In a way, I can
understand what he means
now.{enter}
Though my Id power isn't
good enough, if it has
the same quality as
Grahf's...I..."

#### 4 ####
Fei
"If you did that, 
you'd be..."

#### 5 ####
Fei
"Thanks Elly, but no.{enter}
Even if I left the
battle field, there's
no guarantee that Id'll
never appear again.{enter}
Besides...
I tried to kill you...
You're still okay with
that?"

#### 6 ####
Fei
"Elly..."

#### 7 ####
Elly
"But you're the same Fei
I've always known.{enter}
You returned to your old
self. Please don't be
obsessed with it."

#### 8 ####
Elly
"They're not thinking
about what they're
saying!{enter}
They're just confused by
your powers!"

#### 9 ####
Elly
"Let's escape.{enter}
If Grahf, or the war
brings out Id, let's
go to a place where
no wars exist."

#### 10 ####
Elly
"That's alright...{wait:14}
I don't have a place to
go back, either..."

#### 11 ####
Elly
"Then you could've killed
me if you really wanted
to, right?{enter}
The other you, Id's power
is nothing like that.{wait:14}
But you still didn't go
through with it.{enter}
You knew when it was
enough. Isn't that
because your will was in
effect?"

#### 12 ####
Elly
"If you're to be controlled
by Id and all those around
you became your enemies...{enter}
I'd still be by your side.
...Because...{wait:1E}
Because...{wait:14}I know it's
lonely to be by yourself."

#### 13 ####
Elly
"I'll open it now.{wait:14}
Let's go, Fei."

#### 14 ####
This is where we keep the
criminals in their cells.{wait:14}
It's been said that
soldiers from Solaris were
locked up in here long ago.{enter}
I've heard we've even done
many atrocious things at
that time.{wait:14} 
War is like that. It
abolishes good and bad.{enter}
One betrays friends,
neighbors, even his own
flesh and blood...{wait:14}
War turns even good, kind
humans into crazed monsters.

#### 15 ####
This is a Carbonite Cage
that petrifies humans
alive.{wait:14} Regardless of
whether it was only used
on criminals, it is still
heinous.{enter}
No matter how you look at
it, they've sure thought
of cruel things.

#### 16 ####
By the way, you land
dwellers know about the
Nisan tragedy during
the great war?{enter}
Did you hear anything
from the higher ups?
    Yes
    No

#### 17 ####
I'm surprised they told
you. So, you know what it
is, don't you?{enter}
Don't believe everything
those old men say.{wait:14}
Nothing good will come
of it.

#### 18 ####
I doubt they told you.
Those old men politely
avoid talking about it.{enter}
Do they think the truth
will disappear if they
turn away from the past?{wait:14}
Bunch of fools!

#### 19 ####
Be careful, land dweller.
You'll have a terrible time
if you open up your heart 
to those old men.{enter}
Just like they did in
Nisan, 500 years ago...
