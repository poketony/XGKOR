Big Joe
"Ha, how easy it is
to beat you, amigo!
Go away."

#### 4 ####
Big Joe
"Ha...a draw.
Very lucky for you
senor..."

#### 5 ####
Big Joe
"Hey, hombre. You
disturbin' our amore time?"{enter}
    Yes
    No

#### 6 ####
Big Joe
"Si? Maybe you need some
manners, muchacho!"

#### 7 ####
Big Joe
"Well then go away."

#### 8 ####
Oh Joe, mi amore!

Bart
"Sorry about what I
said earlier..."

#### 10 ####
Fei
"It's alright. I was at
fault too. I haven't seen
you in such a long time.{enter}
We shouldn't be fighting."

#### 11 ####
Bart
"Sigh{wait:05}...{wait:05}{enter}
The Yggdrasil II was
constructed so quickly
we had no time to ready
its depth charges.{enter}
Also it was my fault we
didn't have depth charges
because I prioritized the
Bart Missiles over...{enter}
...everything else."

#### 12 ####
Fei
"Bart Missiles?"

#### 13 ####
Bart
"Oh uh...um, well,
they're not that
great anyway."

#### 14 ####
Fei
"?{wait:14}
Anyway, I'm glad you're
okay.{enter}
I always knew that you'd
be alive."

#### 15 ####
Bart
"Of course.
I'm Bart the immortal.
Whaddya trying to say{wait:05}...?{enter}
But this time I got reamed
by a red Gear monster."

#### 16 ####
Fei
"A red Gear..."

#### 17 ####
Bart
"Yeah. He beat me and then
left us to sink into the
sand.{enter}
But this next part sounds
wild.{enter}
We sank into this huge cave
under the sand! {wait:0A}And then
a sand cruiser just like
the Yggdrasil was there!{enter}
We replaced the usable
parts and the bridge and
remodeled it."

#### 18 ####
Citan
"Frankly, I do not believe
it myself. It looks
the same but it can float.{enter}
Most likely it is the
Yggdrasil's prototype."

#### 19 ####
Bart
"People lived there
long ago and they
had many weapons.
That's how we got them."

#### 20 ####
Citan
"Bart already showed me.
Those weapons are most
likely...{wait:0A}from Shevat."

#### 21 ####
Fei
"Shevat...{wait:05}...{wait:05}
you mean the aerial..."

#### 22 ####
Bart
"More importantly, we
should go say 'ahoy'
to the Captain."

#### 23 ####
Fei
"...Yeah."
