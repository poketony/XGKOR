Fei, hang in there!{clear:3C}

#### 2 ####
Fei
"...{wait:14}...{wait:14}...{wait:14}...{wait:14}
Y...you traitor!!"

#### 3 ####
Fei
"Don't stop, Bart!!
He betrayed us!
He betrayed us and Elly!"

#### 4 ####
Fei
"Let go!
Lemme go!"

#### 5 ####
Fei
"Billy!?..."

#### 6 ####
Fei
"What...
But doc was just...
Is that true?"

#### 7 ####
Fei
"Doc?"

#### 8 ####
Fei
"I see how it is..."

#### 9 ####
Fei
"For sure?"

#### 10 ####
Fei
"...?"

#### 11 ####
Fei
"Wait!
What happened to Elly?
Weren't you with her?"

#### 12 ####
Fei
"Why only Elly...?"

#### 13 ####
Fei
"Is that why...Elly...?"

#### 14 ####
Fei
"What about doc...?"

#### 15 ####
Fei
"Doc!
A sword...?"

#### 16 ####
Fei
"...I see...
...But..."

#### 17 ####
Fei
"You're always so
mischievous, doc..."

#### 18 ####
Bart
"Fei, you're conscious?
Now! Let's go!"

#### 19 ####
Bart
"S, stop!  Fei!"

#### 20 ####
Bart
"Stop! Fei!
It's your mistake!"

#### 21 ####
Bart
"Hmph...{wait:20}
If Billy says it you 
listen..."

#### 22 ####
Bart
"Listen very carefully!{enter}
That Limiter is implanted
in our bodies.{enter}
Right now,
this research facility
is the only place where
we can get them removed!{enter}
Citan misled Krelian and
the other guys and brought
us in here to remove the
Limiter!"

#### 23 ####
Bart
"Yeah!"

#### 24 ####
Bart
"By the way, Citan.
You did remove Fei's
Limiter, didn't you?"

#### 25 ####
Bart
"Alright then. 
Let's get out of here!"

#### 26 ####
Bart
"I don't care what the
reason is! For now,{enter}
let's help Elly and
get out of here fast!"

#### 27 ####
Bart
"Yo! Citan!
Let me handle Fei and
Elly's situation!{enter}
Now that the Limiter is
removed, Solaris doesn't
stand a chance!"

#### 28 ####
Bart
"A...are you serious...?"

#### 29 ####
Billy
"Calm down, Fei! {enter}
Bart isn't lying,
Citan is the one
who helped us!"

#### 30 ####
Billy
"There's no Limiter?
Isn't that because Elly is 
from Solaris?"

#### 31 ####
Billy
"You're right.{enter}
If we mess up here,
I put those guys who went
to help Elly's parents in
danger."

#### 32 ####
Billy
"Citan, we're going to
Krelian's private
research lab as planned.{enter}
We'll meet up at
the rendezvous point."

#### 33 ####
Citan
"That is not the only
reason why I brought
you here.{enter}
Those who want to
become independent
from Solaris{enter}
must know the actual
situation and
its true form.{enter}
Who is doing what and why."

#### 34 ####
Citan
"Ostensibly,{enter}
I received a covert
order from the Emperor
to contact the body{enter}
wanted by the Ministry
and send the data...{enter}
and if possible bring
the body back.{enter}
That was my duty.
As a result, I had no
choice but to deceive you.
Please forgive me."

#### 35 ####
Citan
"Besides,{enter}
I myself had
a matter that had be
verified in this
facility..."

#### 36 ####
Citan
"I'll tell you that after
we escape from here.{enter}
It is something you must
know."

#### 37 ####
Citan
"...What?"{wait:20}
Y...yes, of course...
That is..."

#### 38 ####
Citan
"Elly was taken to
Krelian's research lab.
It could not be stopped.{enter}
I am sorry."

#### 39 ####
Citan
"I do not know...{enter}
But one thing bothers
me...When Krelian took
Elly,{enter}
I had a chance to acquire
Elly's cellular
information.{enter}
I analyzed it and found
something very interesting
...Excuse me, I mean...
unusual.{enter}
There is no 
Limiter implanted in her."

#### 40 ####
Citan
"Even Solaris citizens
have a Limiter implanted
when they are born.{enter}
There are exceptions for
certain people like myself
and Ramsus,{enter}
whose Limiters can be
removed later on through
the treatment such as the
one I did for Bart.{enter}
But you must
have permission from the
Ministry to do so."

#### 41 ####
Citan
"There must be more to it
than that. I don't know
the reason,{enter}
but Krelian is so
absorbed by her data."

#### 42 ####
Citan
"There is still something
left to be done. I will go
destroy the last gate."

#### 43 ####
Citan
"Oh, yes! By the way, young
one, about the effects of
removing the Limiter...{enter}
The results will not show
up that quickly. Already
your physical Limiters have
been removed naturally.{enter}
The part I have removed is
the psychological section.{enter}
That is...the subconscious
fear and veneration for the
Ministry and the emperor
have been removed.{enter}
Basically, you will be able
to battle against them
without any fears or
hesitations.{enter}
It is not that you have
suddenly become more
powerful."

#### 44 ####
Citan
"...Yes.
Yui gave it to me as
I was leaving.{enter}
I used to use it before
I met her.{wait:0A} For a long time
I vowed not to use it for
killing though.{enter}
But now is not the time to
contemplate morals. It is
not fair for me to be the
only 'innocent' one."

#### 45 ####
Citan
"Yes?"

#### 46 ####
Citan
"It is in my nature.
I am sorry, forgive me."
