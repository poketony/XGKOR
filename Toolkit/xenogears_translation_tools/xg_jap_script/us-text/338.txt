What's this movie...?

#### 2 ####
A record of the Zeboim
culture that died out
4000 years ago.

#### 3 ####
Stop it!
Who is this woman...?

#### 4 ####
Miang, as she appeared
in the Zeboim era.
But I don't know who
her host body was.{enter}
She resided at the side
of the  Prime Minister,
manipulating the world
behind the scenes.

#### 5 ####
To resurrect Deus?

#### 6 ####
In the beginning, yes.
But later it was different.{enter}
Many people then, couldn't
have children. They were
defective humans...
So...she did it over again.

#### 7 ####
Right before man was about
to be killed out by war, a
new being was born to foster
the next generation.{enter}
Remember the missiles in
the Mass-driver facility?
That was the most important
thing to the Zeboim people.{enter}
Because of that, we now are
descendants of the few
strong people who survived.

"A slipping economy...
Rising crime...
Urban blight...{enter}
A nation of fanatics
looking for their own
living space...{enter}
...believing in religious
sect leaders and gathering
around totalitarian rulers.{enter}
These people were cut off
from the next generation
thanks to genetic damage...{enter}
...and would have died out,
if left to their own
devices.{enter}
So, Elly and I took the
hopes of the people and
created Emeralda..."
