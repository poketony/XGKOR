"Are you ready? {wait:0A}
I am going later so get 
some rest before then."

Citan
"Fei, there is no need to
be mad at Bart. {wait:0A}
Just forgive him."

#### 3 ####
Citan
"Fei, there is no reason 
to be mad at Bart. {wait:0A}
Just forgive him."

Sigurd
"We set out early tomorrow.{wait:0A}{enter}
It's best to get ready
today and rest up in our
rooms from the journey."

#### 5 ####
Sigurd
"I'm searching the 
information network {enter}
for reports on
Aveh's condition."

#### 6 ####
Sigurd
"What do you want to know?{wait:0A}
    {fast:FF}Who is Margie?
    Who is Shakhan?
    What's a Fatima Jasper?
    More about Nisan
    Nothing

#### 7 ####
Sigurd
"Margie is Mother 
Marguerite of Nisan.{enter}
But Shakhan of Aveh has
locked her up and is
looking for the Fatima
Jasper now. {enter}
Bart may not look it,
but he's very worried."

#### 8 ####
Sigurd
"Shakhan was the Prime
Minister of Aveh.{enter}
But he is the defacto
leader now.{wait:0A}
His rule is what has
put our Aveh in turmoil."

#### 9 ####
Sigurd
"Margie has half of the 
Fatima Jasper.{enter}
Shakhan wants it because
it tells the location of
the great treasure."

#### 10 ####
Sigurd
"Nisan is a small,
sacred country in the
west of Ignas.{enter}
In its center is a huge
cathedral beautifully
ornamented. {enter}
The country was founded
by Sophia.{enter}
She is called the
'Mother of Knowledge'
by her followers, the
-Kahal-.{enter}
She was also Nisan's 
first Mother."

Citan
"This place is incredible!{enter}
They probably do not even
have equipment like this
in the capital."

#### 26 ####
Bart
"Heh heh. Surprised? {wait:0A}
All this technology
is thanks to Sig."

#### 27 ####
Bart
"Hey, Fei!{wait:0A}
Don't stand on the screen.{wait:0A}
We won't be able to see!"

#### 28 ####
Bart
"Alright men!{wait:0A}
Display my special file
on the main screen."

#### 29 ####
Citan
"What is this...?"

#### 30 ####
Bart
"A picture scroll, nearly
500 years old.{enter}
This is King Fatima I...{wait:0A}
'body cloaked in flames
making a blood oath with
giants'.{enter}
They say he used the
strength of the giants
to found Aveh."

#### 31 ####
Citan
"It is amazing that such an
ancient scroll exists...
and in such good state too!{enter}
I thought the 'Ethos'
controlled all such things
as these..."

#### 32 ####
Bart
"Normally, yes.{enter}
But this was one of
my father's prized
possessions."

#### 33 ####
Bart
"Next!"

#### 34 ####
Bart
"After founding the
country, Fatima forced the
giants into slumber{wait:05}...{enter}
...{wait:05}to protect his kingdom's
people if needed in the
future.{wait:0F} But we don't know
where they are hidden.{enter}
In another record, one of
the giants is called the
'Great Fatima Treasure'."

#### 35 ####
Citan
"What about
the 'Jasper'?"

#### 36 ####
Bart
"Hey...{wait:0A}
you sure know a lot.{enter}
Perhaps you're one
of Shakhan's spies?"

#### 37 ####
Citan
"Of course not.{wait:0A}
It is only an intellectual
interest..."

#### 38 ####
Bart
"Just kidding.{wait:0A} It appears
the Jasper is the key to
finding our treasure."

#### 39 ####
Citan
"A key...{enter}
Could that be what
Shakhan is looking 
for?"

#### 40 ####
Bart
"Not just him.{wait:0A}
Gebler is also
looking for it."

#### 41 ####
Citan
"Really?{enter}
Then we must rescue
Marguerite as soon
as possible."

#### 42 ####
Bart
"You're telling me!"

#### 43 ####
Bart
"Since we helped you{wait:05}...{wait:0A}I
was wondering if I could,
in turn, ask you a favor?"

#### 44 ####
Citan
"Would that be{wait:05}...{wait:05}
for us to help you
rescue her{wait:0A}...?"

#### 45 ####
Bart
"Bright boy!{wait:0A}
That's exactly it.{enter}
I heard from Sigurd{wait:05}...{wait:0A}
it seems that both Aveh
and Kislev are after you!{enter}
So we can help you and
you can help us{wait:05}...{wait:0A}
How about it?{wait:0A} 
It's not much to ask."

#### 46 ####
Citan
"Well, if it pays for my
room and board then I will
help in any way I can..."

#### 47 ####
Citan
"What do you think, Fei?{wait:0A}
You have not said
anything for a while..."

#### 48 ####
Bart
"Yeah.{wait:0A}
You were great back there
in that stalactite cavern.{enter}
Your strength alone is
greater than ten or twenty
of Shakhan's guards."

#### 49 ####
...

#### 50 ####
Bart
"I'd love to have
your power on my
side!"

#### 51 ####
Fei
"Why does everyone want
to make me fight?"

#### 52 ####
Bart
"H, huh...{wait:0A}
What's wrong with you
all of a sudden?"

#### 53 ####
Fei?

#### 54 ####
Fei 
"I just don't feel like it!
'Love to have my power'?{wait:0A}
I don't have any!{enter}
What's wrong with you,{wait:05}
doc,{wait:05} everyone{wait:05}...{wait:0A}
You're driving me to the
brink.{enter}
Then there's that Gear{wait:05}...{wait:05}
Grahf and my father{wait:05}...{enter}
I don't have the time to
help you out with your
problems when I've got
enough of my own!!"

#### 55 ####
Bart
"What's with him?{wait:0A}
Is he always that
short-tempered?"

#### 56 ####
Citan
"No, that is not it...{wait:0A}
I am sorry.{enter}
Things have happened so
fast that he has not had
time to deal with it all
yet.{wait:0A} Try to understand."
