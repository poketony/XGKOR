"This time when the 
government changes, the
implications are huge.{enter}
We must succeed at all
costs."

#### 2 ####
Bart
"...Sig and I will
take two men and head
for the top floor.{enter}
Citan, you take the two
remaining men and open
the castle gate to let
in our main force.{enter}
If we can catch Shakhan
we are sure to succeed."

#### 3 ####
Citan
"Right. When you capture 
Shakhan give the signal.{enter}
It is probably best to 
open the gate at that 
time."

#### 4 ####
Bart
"Above us is the
Castle Bailey.{enter}
The keep must fall
quickly.
Shakhan should be
on the top floor."

#### 5 ####
Sigurd
"...In the room that
used to be used by the
young master's father.{enter}
Try not to damage the
castle, avoid all need-
less combat, and above
all, remember - speed!"

#### 6 ####
Bart
"That's why there are so
few of us.{enter}
Our objective is Shakhan!
So ignore the Gebler and
Aveh soldiers."

#### 7 ####
Bart
"Alright, let's
move on out!"

#### 8 ####
Sigurd
"Young master, don't
try to be a hero...
just get the job done."

#### 9 ####
Damn Shakhan...
When I get a hold of him
I'll swing him around by
his hair...after I've given
him a hair transplant.

#### 10 ####
Pull yourself together.

#### 11 ####
Let's not fight with
our cousins in the Aveh
army and finish this.

#### 12 ####
Soon I'll return to the
castle! I wonder if the
old man from the dining
hall is still alive?

#### 13 ####
Congratulations on your
return, your Highness.{enter}
I knew this day would come
and have been protecting
the water reservoir.{enter}
I knew you didn't die.

#### 14 ####
Even though the war
is over, this old man
has no home or family
to return to.{enter}
My only family is this
stray cat.

#### 15 ####
Kid, how many times
must I tell you...hmm?{enter}
How many years has it
been?{enter}
Well, haven't you grown
up? Are you really the
child I used to play
hide-and-seek with?{enter}
Is this some sort of
joke...?
Well, answer me!?

#### 16 ####
Bart
"What're you babblin'
on about?{enter}
Old man, even back when
I was a child you used
to ramble on and on. But
I see it's gotten worse."

#### 17 ####
What!?
Ramble!?
Did you say I rambled on?
Why you little brat.{enter}
The only people who I ever
allowed to call me a rambler
were my late mother and the
young prince.{enter}
His Highness...
what was his name?

#### 18 ####
Bart
"You mean his Highness
'Prince Bartholomew'."

#### 19 ####
Yes, his Highness Prince
Bartholomew! Boy, you 
certainly know a lot.{enter}
If Bartholomew was still
alive he'd be just about
your age...{enter}
Did you know that both
he and his family were
killed by that Shakhan?{enter}
You won't beat me, 
Shakhan. I'll protect
Aveh's water till I die.{enter}
In rememberance of the 
kindness of the king and 
the young prince.

#### 20 ####
I'll protect Aveh's water 
till I die. In rememberance 
of the kindness of the king 
and the young prince.

#### 21 ####
Bart
"Really? Thanks old man. 
Father would be glad."

#### 22 ####
?{wait:32} 
...Whaddya mean, father?
Are you the son of an
acquaintance of mine?{enter}
Wait wait, I remember...{wait:C8}
£¡{wait:1E} 
No, no, that's not it.{enter}
I don't recall the king
having any secret sons.

#### 23 ####
Bart
"Sorry but I don't have 
time to explain. You'll 
remember. See ya!"

#### 24 ####
Who was that...?

#### 25 ####
Could this be{wait:05}...{wait:05}His
Highness Bartholomew?{wait:32}
It's been a long time.{enter}
You were still a child
when your father, the
King, passed away.{enter}
How I miss those days.
I am glad to see that
you are still alive!

#### 26 ####
Bart
"Old man, that was then
but this is now.{enter}
When things calm down,
I'll come back."

#### 27 ####
What!? Playing in the
reservoir again? Get up 
out of there now, boy!

#### 28 ####
What!?
You can't go in there! 
Everyone drinks from
that water!
