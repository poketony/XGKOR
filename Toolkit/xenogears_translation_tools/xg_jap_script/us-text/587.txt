Hey, I've got all kinds
of good stuff here.{wait:14}
Hey, you need anything?

#### 2 ####
Hey, many thanks!{wait:14}
Come on back anytime you
need anything...hey!?

#### 3 ####
Hey-hey, welcome.
What can I do for
you today, hey?

#### 4 ####
Hey, thanks.
Come again.

#### 5 ####
It's gotten awfully cold.{wait:14}
I hate the cold!
It's killing me...{enter}
If the temperature keeps
dropping like this, we'll
all be frozen before Deus
can finish us off.

#### 6 ####
Us people of Shevat have
always dreamed of coming
down to live on the
planet's surface...{enter}
But we didn't ever imagine
this would be how we would
realize that dream!{wait:14}
...This is unbearable!

#### 7 ####
Though this base is the
last refuge for humans...{wait:14}
as you can no doubt see we
have almost no supplies.{enter}
Anyway, we're using a
fallen piece of Shevat
as the main base...{wait:14}
But you probably could
have guessed that, huh.{enter}
If we can take out Deus
even one day sooner...{wait:14}
We can't hold out much
longer like this.

#### 8 ####
Aveh, Kislev, Nisan...
We've been feuding for such
a long time, but finally we
are coming together as one
like this...{enter}
But it's probably already
too late...{wait:14}
It's always the case.
By the time we notice 
anything, it's way too late.{enter}
How could we possibly
stand up to god's army?{wait:14}
The situation's
really hopeless.

#### 9 ####
So many have died...{wait:14}
If this continues,
even more will die.{enter}
It's the same as 500 years
ago. {wait:14}That tragedy and
hardship is being repeated
again...{enter}
What's going to happen
to our world...{wait:14}
What's going to happen
to us...!

#### 10 ####
Burn, burn...!{wait:14}
Burn up this
whole world...!{enter}
My home, my whole family,
everything's been
destroyed by them...{enter}
Who cares anymore,
burn it all up!!
Hahahaha...

#### 11 ####
It's not like we're
born just to die...?{enter}
What's going to
happen to us now? {wait:14}
To this world...{enter}
We can't carry on without
at least drinking...{wait:14}
It's scary and lonely...

#### 12 ####
Did you say you still
needed something else?

#### 13 ####
Hey buddy, did you
need something?{enter}
If you need something
come talk to me at the
counter.{enter}
I have to make things
really clear or else
it gets on my nerves.

#### 14 ####
Hey buddy!
You need something?{wait:14}
Hey, hang on a minute!

#### 15 ####
Thanks.
Come again and I'll
give you a better deal.{wait:14}
(Yeah... Better you 
than me... Haha!)

#### 16 ####
I'm not giving you your
money back!{wait:14} They ran away
after I sold them to you.

#### 17 ####
Hey, aren't these Picotiles
cute?{wait:14} They're going 'cheap,
cheap' too! How about it?

#### 18 ####
Wanna buy my Picotiles?{wait:14}
    Buy Picotiles!
    Don't buy any

#### 19 ####
Alright!
20000G for the lot!{wait:14}
And no haggling for a
discount! So pay up!

#### 20 ####
Forced to pay 20000G.

#### 21 ####
Thanks.{wait:14}
They're really delicious
if you grill them...

#### 22 ####
Aaaaaaaah...!!{clear:3C}

#### 23 ####
I know nothing!{wait:0A}
...{wait:05}Nothing!

#### 24 ####
You don't have enough money.
Well maybe next time then...
'Cheepskate'!

#### 25 ####
Tsk, are you mocking me?
This isn't a game you know!
Get outta here!

#### 26 ####
Argh! Burning! Burning!{wait:14}
All of my rare first
edition books and
valuable autographs!!{enter}
I know supplies are short,{wait:14}
but I can't believe they
are burning my treasures!

#### 27 ####
Do you want to go up?{wait:0A}
    Yes
    No
