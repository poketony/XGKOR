Citan
"Blood...?{enter}
It certainly is covered
in blood... And this...
scorching heat... No,
maybe it is radiation?{enter}
Perhaps it is an emergency
disinfection system...
These marks are evidence
that it has been used..."

#### 3 ####
Citan
"! {enter}
Elly!"

#### 4 ####
Citan
"What the..."

#### 5 ####
Citan
"This girl appears to be an
artificial lifeform created
inside the reactor.{enter}
She was probably assembled
in the reactor by using
that series in the database
in the control room...{enter}
Her body is most likely..."

#### 6 ####
Citan
"Wait right there!!"{clear:10}

#### 7 ####
Citan
"Then, even their
conversation was
planned..."

#### 8 ####
Citan
"...I believe, we have
inadvertently helped
you out."

#### 9 ####
Citan
"What do you plan to
do with this girl?
What is she?"

#### 10 ####
Citan
"'Salvation'?{wait:2D}
Nice choice of words...{enter}
But coming from you, I
only smell the taint
of blood within that
word."

#### 11 ####
Citan
"Be careful!!
The Elements may look
harmless!{enter}
But underestimate them 
and it will cost you
dearly!"

#### 12 ####
Elly
"...Blood...{wait:3F}
covered in blood...{wait:2D}
my...{wait:2D}blood...{enter}
There was no pain.
Just...coldness
and sadness..."

#### 13 ####
Elly
"She has been here
all by herself for
all this time..."

#### 14 ####
Elly
"Be careful!!
The Elements are Ramsus'
elite fighters...{enter}
They look harmless but
they're really dangerous."

#### 15 ####
Elly
"No, that's how they
are normally!{enter}
That's what makes them
REALLY dangerous!!"

#### 16 ####
Elly
"No!
We can't allow them
to take this child!"

#### 17 ####
Bart
"Citan...what is...this?
Not even rogue clusters 
can regenerate this fast."

#### 18 ####
Bart
"What the...
Don't go mouthing off!
Get outta my way!"

#### 19 ####
Bart
"...{wait:2D}
Are you serious
about this..."

#### 20 ####
Billy
"Citan...{wait:0A}
This girl...?{enter}
How did she suddenly
change into human
form...?"

#### 21 ####
Billy
"Who in heavens are you!?
We don't have time to
waste talking to you!"

#### 22 ####
Billy
"...{wait:2D}Do you guys just have
too much free time on
your hands?"

#### 23 ####
Billy
"Bishop..."

#### 24 ####
Billy
"An honorable person?
I certainly do not think
you are honorable anymore.{enter}
Eliminating the 'Ethos'
and any surface-dwelling
humans who don't agree
with your own will..."

#### 25 ####
Billy
"...There is something
very wrong with that.{enter}
Salvation by faith is
something that everyone
should have an equal
opportunity at attaining."

#### 26 ####
Billy
"..."

#### 27 ####
Billy
"Salvation or not...
What are you planning on
doing with this girl!?{enter}
I just know your deeds
are not honorable.{enter}
Bishop...I am sorry to
say this but...I cannot
be a part of what
you are intent on doing."

#### 28 ####
Rico
"What's with this thing?
Us demi-humans can't even
heal at that speed."

#### 29 ####
Rico
"You're don't know what
you're sayin'...{enter}
You really wanna fight?
I'd prefer it if you'd
just move outta the way."

#### 30 ####
Rico
"...{wait:2D}If you're gonna be
talking for a while,
lemme go on ahead."

#### 31 ####
{name:07:チュチュ}
"What is it? What is it?{enter}
What's wrong with this
girl? How come she's
ready so soon?"

#### 32 ####
{name:07:チュチュ}
"I think they're
insulting us..."

#### 33 ####
{name:07:チュチュ}
"How dare you say
that chu a lady!!{enter}
We don't have the
time chu play now!
Out of the way!"

#### 34 ####
{name:07:チュチュ}
"...Can I go now?"

#### 35 ####
Stone
"...Constructed from
autonomic machines
on a molecular scale...{enter}
In other words, a colony
of nanomachines."

#### 36 ####
Stone
"I'll be taking that
nanomachine colony
with me, thank you...{enter}
That is the existence, or
key -factor-, which god
will guide us by to free
humanity from its yoke."

#### 37 ####
Stone
"So, if you don't mind..."

#### 38 ####
Stone
"Ah, Brother Billy.
You're here too.
This makes matters simple.{enter}
I know you'll understand...
This nanomachine colony 
needs to be in the hands 
of an honorable person.{enter}
It's destined to be the
'salvation of humanity'."

#### 39 ####
Stone
"What is the problem with
eliminating those people
not fit for 'salvation'?{enter}
Why, isn't our very faith
based on the precept that
'only the chosen will be
saved'?"

#### 40 ####
Stone
"Are you saying that you
can save all of humankind?{enter}
If Krelian uses the
nanomachine colony, at
least we can save some
chosen people.{enter}
But you don't understand
how to utilize this.
You can't save anyone.{enter}
Are you willing to take
the responsibility for
the loss you will cause
humankind?"

#### 41 ####
Stone
"My job now is to bring
this nanomachine colony
back to Krelian.{enter}
You see, unlike the
'Ethos', our aim is not
the ancient weapons that
lay in the city ruins.{enter}
I don't think we conflict
with your interests."

#### 42 ####
Stone
"I see that I couldn't
make you understand...{wait:20}
Then it cannot be helped...{enter}
I don't have the time to
convince you further.
Please excuse me, as I
must hurry on ahead."

#### 43 ####
Stone
"Sorry to have kept you 
two ladies waiting...{enter}
It's time for you to do
your job, Elements."

#### 44 ####
Stone
"Tolone! Seraphita!
Buy me as much time
as possible!"

#### 45 ####
Stone
"Thanks.
I'm hopeless
with machines."

#### 46 ####
Stone
"Actually, Krelian hasn't
told me very much.{enter}
Nothing apart from the
'Salvation of Humankind'.{enter}
Anyway, even if I knew
I wouldn't tell you..."

#### 47 ####
...Hmph!

#### 48 ####
Tolone
"We know, we know!
Stop ordering us
around, already!"

#### 49 ####
Tolone
"Yeah, right.
It's only because it
is on Ramsus orders.{enter}
Jeez...!
Now he's got us
protecting this
garbage."

#### 50 ####
Tolone
"Well, that's how it is
folks...It'll help us if
you'd hurry up and lose."

#### 51 ####
Tolone
"Well, excu゛se us!
But we can't let you go
just yet...{enter}
We really don't care much
for Krelian, but if we do
a crappy job it'll make
Ramsus look bad.{enter}
But, thanks to you fools
reviving her, we can get
this mission over with
sooner than we thought."

#### 52 ####
Tolone
"Oh Sera...
Don't tell them that!{enter}
Just as I was building
things up to make us sound
psychologically superior
to them! Damn..."

#### 53 ####
Tolone
"That's 'Positronic-photon
Brain', you idiot!{enter}
'Gin n'tonic Futon'...?
You make me sound like I'm
a sleepy drunk!{enter}
(It's already bad enough
as it is...
'Positronic-photon Brain
Cyborg'...{enter}
That's bound to get us
into trouble with the
makers of 'Star Trech'!)"

#### 54 ####
Tolone
"Uh oh!! Sorry."

#### 55 ####
Tolone
"That's it!!"

#### 56 ####
Tolone
"Seraphita!!
Enough already!{enter}
We've done the job
that was required
of us.
Let's pull out!!"

#### 57 ####
Seraphita
"Hey, Tolone. Let's hurry
up and get this over with
so we can get outta here!{enter}
I don't like dark places!"

#### 58 ####
Seraphita
"Hey! Tolone!
It's so cute{wait:10}...{enter}
But on second thought,
it's creepy!!"

#### 59 ####
Seraphita
"Yeah, we didn't know how
to operate that machinery,
so we were so confused!{enter}
Thank you very much
for your kind help!"

#### 60 ####
Seraphita
"What!...But...{enter}
When people do you a
kindness you should always
say thank you. That's what
grandma always said..."

#### 61 ####
Seraphita
"But, I'm impressed Tolone!
'Psychologically superior'?{enter}
Your 'Gin n'tonic Futon
Brain' cyborg inplants
sure make you smart!"

#### 62 ####
Seraphita
"Sorry!!"

#### 63 ####
Seraphita
"...Tolone,
do we want to be 
called 'harmless'?"

#### 64 ####
Seraphita
"A゛hh!
Tolone!
Wait for me!"
