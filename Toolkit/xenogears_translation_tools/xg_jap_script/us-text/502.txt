"Fei, let us hurry!!
They will find us
here easily!"

Citan

no time to waste."

Citan
"So that we do not stand
out, we should split up
into two groups.{enter}
Fei, you have done a lot,
but I would like to have
you move on ahead and take
two more members with you.{enter}
Move along southwest of
here and cross two mobile
contact bridges.{enter}
There you will find a
hangar that will lead to
the outside.{enter}
We will meet at the
footbridge near there.{enter}
If you talk to the blue
memory cubes you will be
able to make contact with
the other party members.{enter}
You can thus change which
members you wish to have
in your current party."

Citan
"...Okay.
Please do not overdo it."

same as you."

#### 17 ####
Erich
"We'd like to thank you,
too. I never thought I'd 
see my daughter again...{enter}
Thank you, Hammer."

#### 18 ####
Erich
"I'll go to the hangar
beforehand, and arrange
a ride for us.{enter}
Solaris is in confusion
now, so if I go alone I 
can pull some strings."

#### 19 ####
Erich
"Yeah, I know."

#### 20 ####
Erich
"Elly, Medena...
See you again."

#### 21 ####

"Fei,
now we're in the same
boat as you."

#### 22 ####
Medena
"Elly!!"

#### 23 ####
Medena
"Dear...
Please be careful..."

#### 24 ####
Hammer
"H, h, hurry, run away...
Yeah, run away.{enter}
Yeah, that's right!"

#### 25 ####
Better make proper
preparations before
you flee, so...{enter}
Consider this Hammer's
last closing down sale!
     {fast:FF}Items!
     Accessories!

#### 26 ####
Hammer
"Y, yes...{wait:20}
Yes...exactly..."

young."

#### 28 ####
Jessie
"I shut down alarms here
and there when I was 
breaking gates.{enter}
But it's still dangerous.
Be careful!"
