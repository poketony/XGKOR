...The number one gate
generator is 200 kelt
southwest of Nortune and
4000 sharl underground.{enter}
Its interference waves make
guided weapon use impossible
in this area. So up to the
last minute the Hecht must
be piloted manually.{enter}
After canceling stealth
mode, you will provide
direct escort for the Hecht
inside the enemy defense
zone. Any questions?

Elly
"Well..."

#### 3 ####
Yes Lieutenant?

#### 4 ####
Elly
"I understand our escort
orders but what is our
main objective?"

#### 5 ####
That is classified.

#### 6 ####
Elly 
"But without knowing our
objective, our response to
any orders will be slow.{enter}
Even if we're just ordered
to provide cover.
We need to at least know
the attack objective..."

#### 7 ####
The objective will be issued
during the mission.
It will be relayed directly
to the Hecht's pilots.

#### 8 ####
Elly
"But..."

#### 9 ####
Your only concern is to
protect the Hecht from
the enemy's anti-aircraft 
weapons. {wait:3C}
Any problems with that?

#### 10 ####
Elly
"...No...
if that's the case..."{clear:1E}

#### 11 ####
Anything else?

#### 12 ####
...Then this ends the 
main briefing.{enter}
Confirm terrain, weather
and enemy defense details
with the information at
hand.{enter}
The mission starts at
1700.
Until then wait in your
assigned units.{enter}
I shouldn't have to
remind you that this
mission is a purge.{enter}
Remember, we have
complete authority
over the Lambs.{wait:3C} 
Dismissed.

#### 13 ####
Stratski
"This sucks Lieutenant.{enter}
How can we go along with
this? What's he mean the
objective has nothing to
do with us?"

#### 14 ####
Elly
"Be quiet!
I'm thinking!"

#### 15 ####
Stratski
"Don't snap at me."

#### 16 ####
Vance
"I hate hysterical women."{clear:3C}

#### 17 ####
Elly
"Are you ready to take
the consequences for
that remark?"

#### 18 ####
Vance
"Uh..."{clear:1E}
