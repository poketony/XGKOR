There may be a few things
we can do.{enter}
But I've been a soldier
all my life.{enter}
I can't sit still as
long as there are
people to protect and
enemies to fight.

#### 2 ####
...It's a different system
from what humans have been
creating. In other words,
it should be called a
machine made by non-humans.{clear:3C}

#### 3 ####
It wasn't made by humans.
That I can see. But what I
want to know is if it's a
machine to begin with.{clear:3C}

#### 4 ####
It doesn't matter whether
it's a machine or a
creature. Nothing can't be
broken. The question is
how we can damage it.{clear:3C}

#### 5 ####
Be quiet!{wait:1E}
Sister!{wait:1E}
Please take the
children elsewhere.

#### 6 ####
You want the children to
stand in the cold hallway!?{wait:32}
This is the warmest room.
Why can't they stay here?

#### 7 ####
We're having a very
important meeting.
They're disturbing us.

#### 8 ####
Please don't get so upset.{wait:32}
I really appreciate that
you're trying to protect
us.{enter}
But you know those people
are the only ones who can 
change our fate...{wait:32}
don't you?

#### 9 ####
Really, how can we fight
against an enemy like that?

#### 10 ####
You think it's just going to
sit there while we gather
all of Aveh's and Kislev's
armies...?

#### 11 ####
I'm prepared to protect
everyone here.

#### 12 ####
I want to help people.
But all I know how to
do is fight.

#### 13 ####
I had doubts about fighting
before, but not about
protecting the people here.

#### 14 ####
If we had more weapons...

#### 15 ####
We gotta do what we can.

#### 16 ####
The children are annoying,
but, they're the reason
why I'm here.

#### 17 ####
Kids are all the same
in Kislev, Aveh and Nisan.

#### 18 ####
We both no longer have
anything to lose.{enter}
Do as you wish.{wait:3C}
I hope you'll have
help from heaven.

#### 19 ####
Now more than ever I feel
as if each child is very
important.

#### 20 ####
This is the first time
I've seen snow.{enter}
It's so light and white,
and a beautiful pattern
appears for an instant
then it melts on my palm.{enter}
It's amazing...

#### 21 ####
I wanna see my mom and dad.

#### 22 ####
What is it?
Can I do that too?

#### 23 ####
Her outfit is so cute,
isn't it?

#### 24 ####
My grandma made this for
my mom when she was a
child. It's really warm.

#### 25 ####
Good luck to you too.{wait:1E}
I...{wait:0A}will protect these
people, so don't worry.

#### 26 ####
Uh...{wait:1E}I'll play with
the sister.{wait:1E}

#### 27 ####
I am Yggdrasil X!
Come on! Catch me
if you can!{clear:3C}

#### 28 ####
Hey!
Give my candy back!{clear:3C}
