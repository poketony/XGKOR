Citan
"It is no use. The knee
actuator and bypass
circuit are both ruined.{enter}
The actuator can be fixed,
but the circuit needs 
to be replaced..."

#### 2 ####
Citan
"Oh, having trouble
sleeping there?"

#### 3 ####
Elly
"Yeah..."

#### 4 ####
Citan
"I imagine you would.
You have had quite a day."

#### 5 ####
Citan
"This is the machine Fei
used when the village was
attacked.{enter}
There was another machine
left sitting on the
outskirts of the village...{enter}
Nil bayer dars legus?
(It was yours, right?)"

#### 6 ####
!{clear:14}

#### 7 ####
Citan
"Just as I thought...{enter}
The missing pilot from the
Gear that made an emergency
landing in Lahan...{enter}
...and the mysterious woman
found wandering lost in the
forest...are actually one
and the same person.{enter}
Judging from your uniform,
I would also say you are
with the military...
Am I correct?"

#### 8 ####
Elly
"How...?
Who are you?"

#### 9 ####
Citan
"I checked the ID tags of
of the soldiers who died
in the attack on Lahan...{enter}
The design on their tags
and the design on your
uniform there is the same."

#### 10 ####
!

#### 11 ####
Citan
"Do not worry, they were
given proper burials.{enter}
But, they may not have
been too pleased to die
in a foreign land."

#### 12 ####
Elly
"...Maybe."

#### 13 ####
Citan
"Does Fei know 
about you?"

#### 14 ####
Elly
"I don't think he
has realized yet."

#### 15 ####
Citan
"Most likely...
Fei knows nothing of the
world outside of Lahan."

#### 16 ####
Elly
"I see...
So how come..."

#### 17 ####
Citan
"...In any case, it is best
if we do not pry into each
other's pasts anymore."

#### 18 ####
Elly
"But..."

#### 19 ####
Citan
"Let us just say that I
know a little more about
the world than most do."

#### 20 ####
Citan
"Anyway, Elly...
I have a favor I must
beg you to do..."

#### 21 ####
Elly
"...What is it?"

#### 22 ####
Citan
"Go straight ahead and
you will come to a road.{enter}
Then just keep going...
Would you please leave us
while Fei is still asleep?"

#### 23 ####
!?

#### 24 ####
Citan
"Unfortunate things keep
happening around Fei.{enter}
I would like to protect
him if possible...
I do not want him caught
up in any vain struggles.{enter}
I am also saying this for
your benefit.
Elly, you do not belong
here.{enter}
Go back to your family."

#### 25 ####
Elly
"Um...I..."

#### 26 ####
Citan
"Do not worry.
I will not tell Fei what
your true identity is.{enter}
I will...just tell him
you went to meet up
with your family..."

#### 27 ####
Elly
"No, it is not that!
I did something
terrible to him...{enter}
So...I want to...
apologize."

#### 28 ####
Citan
"Something terrible?"

#### 29 ####
Elly
"Fei told me it was
our fault your village
was destroyed.{enter}
Fei kept saying...
 'if only they
  hadn't come...'{enter}
Then, I called Fei a
coward because he was
trying to escape from
the responsibility...{enter}
But in fact it was
me who was trying to
escape from taking
the blame..."

#### 30 ####
Elly
"If I hadn't crash-landed
there, they would all still
be living peacefully now.{enter}
All those innocent people
wouldn't have been caught
up in that tragedy.
But I accused Fei..."

#### 31 ####
Citan
"You are a rarity. I did
not expect your people
would ever think like that.{enter}
To your people, surface
dwellers are nothing more
than domesticated animals,
are they not...?"

#### 32 ####
Elly
"'The Shepherds, -Abel-,
  took control over the
  surface dwelling -Lambs-{enter}
  ...possessing the right
  to give life and death
  unto them as they see
  fit...'                 "

#### 33 ####
Citan
"Exactly. Yet you seem to
feel responsiblity toward
Fei and the villagers.{enter}
Why is that?"

#### 34 ####
Elly
"I don't know myself...{enter}
At Jugend I was taught
that surface dwellers
were stupid and base...{enter}
...And that is why we
have to control them...{wait:14}
But..."

#### 35 ####
Citan
"But upon meeting Fei,
something about him made
you feel differently?"

#### 36 ####
Elly
"Yes. He's no different
than we are...in fact he
seemed more powerful.{enter}
He possesses something...
...something we don't.{wait:0A}
He also risked his life
to save me...twice."

#### 37 ####
Citan
"Most of your people
would feel ashamed at
receiving such an act.{enter}
Yet, you are grateful
to Fei...?"

#### 38 ####
Elly
"It's probably because of
my father. He had an open
mind to surface dwellers.{enter}
My nanny was...a surface
dweller. No one knew about
her though...{enter}
Besides...
I am the same as Fei..."

#### 39 ####
Citan
"The same?"

#### 40 ####
Elly
"No, nothing. 
Nevermind..."

#### 41 ####
Citan
"Hmm. I think I understand.
I am sorry. After just
saying we should not pry...{enter}
It is my nature, you know?
My wife says I am too
persistent and that I
talk too much.{enter}
But, personally, I do not
think I talk too much."

#### 42 ####
Citan
"It is probably best
if you return home
to your country.{enter}
You really should
not be here."

#### 43 ####
Elly
"I'll return to
headquarters.
But then what..."

#### 44 ####
Citan
"You are worried..."

#### 45 ####
Elly
"Yes..."

#### 46 ####
Citan
"Worrying is natural...
 'Even I used to worry
  once too, you know!?'"

#### 47 ####
Elly
"Oh, Citan..."

#### 48 ####
Citan
"Anyway, let me handle
what to tell Fei...
You had better go now."
