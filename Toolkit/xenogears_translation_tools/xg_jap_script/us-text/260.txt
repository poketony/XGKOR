#### 1 ####
It's enough work just
to change those fuses
here and there...{clear:1E}

#### 2 ####
More than a specified
output isn't supposed
to be generated.{clear:1E}

#### 3 ####
Aww man!{wait:0A} The levitron's
coil is also burnt...{clear:1E}

#### 4 ####
The coil'll break if the
toroid is cooled down
suddenly...{wait:3C} It's big,
but it's delicate...{clear:3C}

#### 5 ####
The electric circuit
is optimized and...{clear:1E}

#### 6 ####
The levitron's not in
a good mood today.{wait:0A}
The plasma cools down
too quickly...{clear:3C}

#### 7 ####
Is the fuse alright?{clear:1E}

#### 8 ####
It's almost time{wait:05}...{wait:0A}
We may not be able to do
much on the front line,
but we'll give you the
best support we can!

#### 9 ####
There's a new gadget
in the aft...!{enter}
I'm lucky to be able
to work on something
that awesome at my
age... {wait:0A}Hehehe.

#### 10 ####
Don't worry.
It's going great!

#### 11 ####
You're going to
some ghost ship?{wait:0A}
Be careful, now!

#### 12 ####
Elly
"Chief...
I'm very sorry.{wait:0A}
I..."

#### 13 ####
That's alright.{wait:0A}
Everybody makes mistakes.{enter}
I don't find it a problem
with young people making
mistakes!

#### 14 ####
(But, if you do it again,
you're gonna be in deep...!)

#### 15 ####
I've been working on
these engines for many
long years...{enter}
But I can't figure out
why high energy plasma
is produced in the
Slave Generators...{enter}
Actually nobody knows the
generators' mechanism of
either ships or Gears.{enter}
But perhaps that Solaris
may know what Slave
Generators really are...

#### 16 ####
Good, good!!{wait:0A} It's better
than before, since we can
now use water for cooling.{enter}
But because of that,
there's more labor needed.

#### 17 ####
Young master{wait:05}...{wait:0A}doesn't
this place remind you of
the day of that accident?

#### 18 ####
Well the Yggdrasil sank...{wait:0A}
But fortunately we were
able to find this one...{enter}
But whenever I work on
this engine I get this
mysterious feeling...{enter}
Like this ship is somehow
'related' to the previous
one...{wait:0A} Strange, huh!?

#### 19 ####
You failed...{wait:0A}
Well, everyone has their
ups and downs in life.

#### 20 ####
Young master, forget about
the past... What's more
important is the future.{enter}
Today's battle isn't over
yet.

#### 21 ####
A mechanic's greatest
moment is the night
before a mission!{enter}
Tomorrow is that once
in a life time day when
this ship can show what
it's really made of...{enter}
I'm gonna make you
beautiful, old girl!

#### 22 ####
Marguerite has returned
and it sounds like it's
time to settle the score.{enter}
Engine!{wait:05} I'm counting on
you!{wait:0A} When it's over, you
and I can have plenty of
rest...{wait:0A} Good rest...

#### 23 ####
Good job!{wait:0A}
We saved Marguerite!{enter}
I hear some guy called
Fei, a martial artist,
helped us out there.

#### 24 ####
Y, you, quit loafing
around here and go
concentrate on training
like that guy Fei!!

#### 25 ####
Here we go!
This time you're going
to save Marguerite!{enter}
I gave you enough fuel
...so let's go get her!

#### 26 ####
Phew, finally I can let
her rest. Take plenty of
rest while you still can!

#### 27 ####
Nobody touches the machine
here except myself.
Even the young master!

#### 28 ####
Uhh... Young master...

#### 29 ####
Whoa whoa!!
That{wait:0A} was close!{clear:1E}

#### 30 ####
Engine Full Power!

#### 31 ####
Guys from Shevat installed
tons of stuff for me...{wait:0A}
so it's much more fun to
work on!

#### 32 ####
See you later!

#### 33 ####
...{wait:0A}
You're alright, aren't you?{wait:0A}
You're the normal Elly, right?

#### 34 ####
Awh shoot!!{wait:0A}
I must restore it again
because of that girl!!

#### 35 ####
Phew...
It's somehow moving alright.
Now, I've got to restore it.

#### 36 ####
Young master{wait:05}...{wait:05}do you
think the sunken Yggdrasil
is resting in peace now?

#### 37 ####
I wonder if the engine of
our old sunken Yggdrasil is
weeping in the deep sand...

#### 38 ####
No, she's resting there.
We ought to believe it
must be the best place
for her,{wait:0A} otherwise...

#### 39 ####
This Yggdrasil is still here.{wait:0A}
As long as it's in good shape,
we can do many more rematches!

#### 40 ####
That old man is all
fired up with zeal...{wait:0A}
I sure hope his blood
vessels don't burst...

#### 41 ####
No need to worry!{wait:0A}
His blood vessels are
made of duralumin and
oil flows inside them.

#### 42 ####
Finally, the engine 
can take a rest.

#### 43 ####
When we get to Nisan, we can
give the engine a rest again.{enter}
See the big donut-shape
running along the six poles
standing underneath here?{enter}
The plasma generated inside
there is the power source
for the ship.{enter}
The same goes for the Gears.

#### 44 ####
The old man's in
a good old mood!!

#### 45 ####
You shouldn't go up
there. Trust me.

#### 46 ####
He's always like that.
Don't take it personally.
He's not a bad person.

#### 47 ####
Once again, final checks!{wait:0A}
Every second counts!{wait:05}
The young master forever!

#### 48 ####
When we had engine trouble
a long time ago, the young
master jumped in to fix it.{enter}
Sigurd tried to help the
young master and they both
ended up injuring one eye.

#### 49 ####
We are proud of the young
master, but{wait:05}...{wait:05}he sometimes
rushes into things.{enter}
The chief thinks it's
all his own fault.

#### 50 ####
The chief has a weakness
for young women.

#### 51 ####
W, what! It's expected for
a man to be kind to women, 
isn't it!?

#### 52 ####
(Grrr!!{wait:05}
But you're cold to
your own wife!!)

#### 53 ####
Engine Full Power!

#### 54 ####
I asked the guys from Shevat
about it...{wait:0A} But it sounds
like they don't even know.{enter}
They told me nobody knows how
their country flies anymore.

#### 55 ####
A machine that's kept moving
since ancient times, without
any maintenance, eh...{enter}
I must uncover the secret of
its mechanism.

#### 56 ####
Be careful!

#### 57 ####
!!{wait:0A}
Please don't break
it this time.

#### 58 ####
How could he figure out
this complicated device
so easily...?{enter}
Generally, more than a
specified output can't
be produced.{enter}
What kind of hypnosis
was he under?

#### 59 ####
The Thames sounds like
a fun place to visit.{wait:0A}
I'm gonna sneak out...

#### 60 ####
What the hell are you
sneaking out for!?{wait:0A} Wait
till you're independent!

#### 61 ####
Man,{wait:0A} he heard me!

#### 62 ####
Work,{wait:0A} work!

#### 63 ####
She'll carry on the
will and mission of its
sister ship, proudly!!

#### 64 ####
Sorry, but I really don't
want to talk about it.{wait:0A}
Please leave me alone...

#### 65 ####
Oh, young master, you're
alright!{wait:0A} What's your plan
from now on?

#### 66 ####
Shoot!{wait:0A} I found a bug
at a time like this!
What should I do{wait:05}...{enter}
I wonder if I'll be
able to fix it by
tomorrow...

#### 67 ####
It's falling apart...

#### 68 ####
We're almost at Nisan!!{wait:0A}
Come on, engine!

#### 69 ####
Engine's doing fantastic!!

#### 70 ####
You shouldn't go up there.

#### 71 ####
He yelled at you, didn't he?
He gets mad at us, too.
He only opens his heart to
his dog, Martle.

#### 72 ####
Amateurs don't
belong here.{wait:0A}
So get lost!

#### 73 ####
