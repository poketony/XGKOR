Bart
"Thanks to you, Aveh has
been taken back from
Shakhan and Gebler.{enter}
Thank you.{enter}
Now, in order to free
other lands from
Gebler and Solaris...{enter}
...we must destroy the
other two gates and
bring down Solaris.{enter}
We've learned from
Shakhan's notes that the
gates form the points 
of a triangle."

#### 2 ####
One point was the Great
Mausoleum. {wait:32}
Two others remain, but we
only know where one is.

#### 3 ####
Citan
"Yes, under the 'Ethos'
headquarters. However..."

#### 4 ####
Billy
"It wasn't there when we
followed Stone under
the 'Ethos' headquarters.{enter}
If it really is there...{wait:1E}
it must be buried deep
beneath the earth..."

#### 5 ####
Rico
"How are we gonna 
destroy it then?"

#### 6 ####
{name:07:チュチュ}
"By combining
everyone's
Gear power."

#### 7 ####
Rico
"What are we gonna do 
with everyone's Gear,{enter}
dig a giant hole in
the ground?"

#### 8 ####
{name:07:チュチュ}
"What's wrong
with that?"

#### 9 ####
Sigurd
"...it would take years."

#### 10 ####
Fei
"What if we used 
Shevat's cannon..."

#### 11 ####
Maria
"If that worked, we would
have tried it already."

#### 12 ####
Fei
"...Oh..."

#### 13 ####
Citan
"So it must be something
more powerful than
Shevat's cannon."

#### 14 ####
Elly
"And we don't have a
Gebler battleship."

#### 15 ####
Fei
"Is there any weapon
that powerful on earth?"

#### 16 ####
Citan
"Gebler battleships and
Shevat's cannon are the
most powerful weapons{enter}
ever produced by man..."

#### 17 ####
Bart
"...but...{wait:1E}
I seem to remember
seeing something..."

#### 18 ####
Sigurd
"What?"

#### 19 ####
Bart
"A weapon with firepower
like those two...{wait:C8}
Yeah! I got it!{enter}
Ft. Jasper!
Her gun can take out
a mountain!
What about that?"

#### 20 ####
Bart
"Citan, what?"

#### 21 ####
Citan
"However powerful the Jasper
may be, how are we going to
aim it at the 'Ethos' H.Q.?{enter}
To damage something that
deep underground we would
have to attack it from
directly above.{enter}
But the Jasper gun is..."

#### 22 ####
Sigurd
"Yes, of course..."

#### 23 ####
Rico
"What, are you sayin' we
should just move Ft.
Jasper on top of Babel?"

#### 24 ####
Billy
"Now that you mention it,
Babel does overlook their
headquarters.{enter}
If we shoot it from there
it might just possibly be
able to reach that far
underground."

#### 25 ####
Sigurd
"But how could we move
Ft. Jasper?"

#### 26 ####
Elly
"It's impossible.
Something that heavy..."

#### 27 ####
{clear:1E}

#### 28 ####
Fei
"Didn't the control room
in Babel control a
cannon or something?{enter}
I think it moved the
giant mirror outside."

#### 29 ####
Bart
"Maria, do you know
of anything like that?"

#### 30 ####
Maria
"I've never heard
anything about it but..."

#### 31 ####
Fei
"But it might be there.
Let's go check."

#### 32 ####
Bart
"Alright..."

#### 33 ####
{clear:1E}

#### 34 ####
Citan
"Wait a moment...{enter}
A giant mirror and a giant
cannon both from the same
ruins?{wait:1E} There might just be
something in this..."

#### 35 ####
Bart
"Like what?"

#### 36 ####
Citan
"Ah...{wait:1E}
I have solved
the puzzle..."

#### 37 ####
Sigurd
"Puzzle, what puzzle?"

#### 38 ####
Citan
"The Babel and Jasper
ruins are from the same
civilzation.{enter}
One far more advanced
than our own...
Do not the two structures
seem similar to you?{enter}
I believe they were both
built with Gears and a
powerful foe in mind."

#### 39 ####
Fei
"Yeah, I noticed that. 
But what's it all mean?"

#### 40 ####
Citan
"It means, the people
who built the giant
mirror at Babel Tower...{enter}
...knew about the giant
gun at Jasper!"

#### 41 ####
Bart
"And...?{wait:1E}
What are you
getting at?"

#### 42 ####
Citan
"We can probably assume
the mirror was built to
reflect something...{enter}
That something being a
beam. A beam shot from
the Jasper gun!"

#### 43 ####
Fei
"Reflect?{wait:1E}
You mean that mirror can
reflect a beam attack?"

#### 44 ####
Citan
"Yes."

#### 45 ####
Rico
"Long ago Babel and
Jasper must have
been at war."

#### 46 ####
Citan
"Not exactly.{enter}
The Babel mirror and
Jasper gun were combined
to make one weapon."

#### 47 ####
Rico
"Whaddya mean?"

#### 48 ####
Elly
"But those things are so
far apart, how could they
be one weapon?"

#### 49 ####
Citan
"Well the gates may be
far apart, but aren't
they still one device?"

#### 50 ####
Elly
"Yes, I see what
you mean but..."

#### 51 ####
Billy
"What did they use
that weapon for?"

#### 52 ####
Citan
"That, I do not know."

#### 53 ####
Bart
"Whatever. The point is
how do we use the
two weapons as one?"

#### 54 ####
Citan
"Aim the Jasper gun at
the mirror and fire.{enter}
The mirror will reflect
the beam on the gate."

#### 55 ####
{clear:1E}

#### 56 ####
Maria
"Do you think it will
work?"

#### 57 ####
Citan
"Theoretically.
It will require a few
minor adjustments..."

#### 58 ####
Sigurd
"Adjusting the mirror
is going to be rather
difficult and tedious."

#### 59 ####
Citan
"If the two weapons are
one, then it should not
be too difficult.{enter}
I hope..."

#### 60 ####
Rico
"It sounds dangerous.{enter}
I think it was meant to
reflect shots back at
the enemy.{enter}
If you're wrong it'll
come back and hit you."

#### 61 ####
Citan
"Yes. That is why it is
most difficult for the
gun crew.{enter}
The mirror must be hit
precisely."

#### 62 ####
Citan
"We will need to divide
into two teams.
One will fire the gun...{enter}
While the other will adjust
the angle of the mirror to
ensure the beam hits the
'Ethos' headquarters.{enter}
Since this was my idea,
I will take the dangerous
part of adjusting the
mirror."

#### 63 ####
Sigurd
"Alright Hyuga, we'll
let you take care of
that...{enter}
...It seems like
your type of job."

#### 64 ####
Fei
"I'll go too.
Doc might need help."

#### 65 ####
Elly
"It might be lonely with
just Citan and Fei.
So I had better go too."

#### 66 ####
Sigurd
"Alright, you three take
Babel. Now what about
the gun?"

#### 67 ####
Billy
"I'll do it. Looks like
my kind of job.{enter}
Don't worry, I won't
miss. I haven't been
using a gun for nothing."

#### 68 ####
Bart
"Well, I probably better
go to the Jasper."

#### 69 ####
{name:07:チュチュ}
"Me chu! {name:07:チュチュ} 
wants to go chu!"

#### 70 ####
Bart
"Then it's settled.{enter}
You go with Citan to aim
the mirror at the 'Ethos'
headquarters.{enter}
We'll aim the Jasper gun
at the mirror.{wait:32}
Let's get back to the
Yggdrasil and get going!"
