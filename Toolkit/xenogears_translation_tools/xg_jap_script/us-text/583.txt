I have a stupid son you
know. He used to fish
for a living but one day
he said he saw a merman
city on the sea floor...{enter}
Since then he hasn't gone out to
sea, he's become a landlubber...{wait:14}
We haven't seen him these past
few years, I don't know what
he's doing now.

Hey, you have a rare
stone there too!
Is it a mermaid's tear...?{wait:14}
They're tough to find.{enter}
And you, girl... You have the
most amazing eyes.{wait:14}
Like they're an ocean treasure
or something... So, let me 
borrow that stone for a bit.

Long ago, I used to

See, it's ready.

Hey, you have a rare
stone there too. Is it
a mermaid's tear...?{wait:14}

My son wore one as a good
luck charm.{wait:14} I wonder if
there is a girl out there
fit to wear your stone?
