"Well then, I will be over
here cheering for you.{enter}
Do not beat him too soon.
The better you do, the
easier it will be for
Bart to sneak in."

"My...what a
handsome boy!"

Citan
"Fei, we can use this
to our advantage!{enter}
If you create a stir at
the Tournament, the guards
will be watching you
rather than their posts.{enter}
It will make it easy for
us to sneak into the
castle and rescue Margie.{enter}
What do you think, Fei?
Will you enter the 
Tournament?"

#### 6 ####
Fei
"Who...me?"

#### 7 ####
Citan
"While you draw the guards'
attention the young one can
sneak into the castle.{enter}
Surely you see that it is
the only way we will get
in?{wait:64} Right...
Let us go sign you up."

#### 8 ####
Citan
"And Fei, do not use
your real name, make
another suitable one."

#### 9 ####
...Brave young men are
spilling their blood on
the front lines. Our army
is the best, but the tides
of war are uncertain. 
To protect the tradition
of Aveh and preserve peace
in this desert, we must all
have unshaking resolve. {wait:1E} 
The desert is a precious
treasure passed down to us
from our ancestors. Here we
can forge our minds and
bodies into one.
Our teachers are the sun 
and wind.{wait:1E} 
We are gathered here today,
with our strong bodies
forged by the desert. {wait:1E}
The sun above us is the
same as that which burns
over our fathers at the
front. The wind blowing
here is the same as that
which whisks our resolve
and prayers to our sons at
the front.{wait:1E}
This Tournament raises our
spirits and renews our
blessings from this desert
we live in.{wait:1E}
Brave ones, warriors, fight
well and do not shame our
brothers at the front."

#### 10 ####
Let the 338th
Tournament begin!{clear:1E}

Shakhan
"Hmm...a moving speech
if I do say so myself."

#### 12 ####
Shakhan
"Oh, Commander Ramsus. 
Sorry to have kept you
waiting. This way, please."

#### 13 ####
Ramsus
"I'm afraid I do not
have the time for such
gay revelry.{enter}
I just dropped by to
bid you farewell."

#### 14 ####
Shakhan
"What a pity. You do not
like our entertainment?"

#### 15 ####
Ramsus
"I find it boring."

#### 16 ####
Miang
"Oh, let it be Commander.
Shakhan is only trying to
show hospitality...{enter}
I personally find martial
arts quite interesting.
I look forward to seeing
the Tournament."

#### 17 ####
Shakhan
"To say this event is a 
tribute to you, Commander, 
is no understatement.{enter}
Your gracious help in our
time of need enabled us to
celebrate the country's
founding today."

#### 18 ####
Ramsus
"Founding, how impudent.
It's not even your 
country.{enter}
Hmph, do as you like."

#### 19 ####
Shakhan
"Miang, how about the
Tournament? Will you grace
us with your company?"

#### 20 ####
Miang
"Yes.
It would be
a pleasure."

#### 21 ####
Shakhan
"Oh, it's starting!"

#### 22 ####
Good luck tomorrow.

Hey, are you gonna fight?
Hmm {wait:64}
...I'd say about 20 to 1.

#### 85 ####
Shoot, can't get any
decent customers today.

#### 86 ####
Yo, dude!
Try and pick the champion?

#### 87 ####
Citan
"The champion of what?"

#### 88 ####
Huh?{wait:1E}
The champion of
the 'Tournament'!

#### 89 ####
Citan
"Do they bet on
this 'Tournament'?"

#### 90 ####
What
What are you talking about?
Tournaments ARE gambling!{enter}
Why do you think people
even come here? To bet on
who will be champion! Duh!

#### 91 ####
Citan
"Excuse us, we have only
just arrived and know
nothing of the Tournament."

#### 92 ####
Oh, tourists, huh?
Well let me tell you about
the Tournament.{enter}
Every year they hold a big
martial arts tournament 
here in Aveh.{enter}
Fighters from all over the
world gather to see who's
strongest. It's like a big
brawl.{enter}
Everyone goes wild over
guessing who'll win. So,
wanna give it a try?

#### 93 ####
Citan
"Betting on the Tournament
...Is that allowed at such
a grand event"

#### 94 ####
You bet. The soldiers
are crazy about it. If
Kislev attacked tomorrow
Aveh would be dust.{enter}
What are you gonna do?
Registration's not over
yet, but all the strong
ones have signed up.{enter}
The rest are only after
the consolation prizes
anyway...

#### 95 ####
Citan
"Let us wait and see.
Some strong ones might
still register."

#### 96 ####
Ha!
What a buncha cowards.

#### 97 ####
To enter...{wait:1E}
Or not to enter...{wait:1E}
That is the question...

#### 98 ####
To watch inside...{wait:1E} 
Or watch outside...{wait:1E}
That is the question...

#### 99 ####
Get ready!
It's starting soon!

#### 100 ####
Woo-hoo! This is gonna be
HOT! I love the sound of
folks smackin' each other!

#### 101 ####
I'm ready already...
What's taking so long?

#### 102 ####
We're almost ready!

#### 103 ####
If I was only 10 years
younger...cough...hack...
I'd whip 'em all...cough.

#### 104 ####
I was born and raised in
Dazil{wait:3C} but this is my 
first Tournament.

#### 105 ####
This is the best place
to see the action for free.
I'm saving my space now!

#### 106 ####
Oh, hey! Those guys in
front are in the way! That
gets me sooo pissed!

#### 107 ####
I'm for the ones that
pay out big. Don't know
much about martial arts
though.{enter}
I sure could use a little
extra house money.

#### 108 ####
My son's in it! I hope
he doesn't get hurt. {wait:3C}
I'm so worried he's going
to get hurt.

#### 109 ####
My cousin's friend
is gonna fight in it.
Pretty cool, huh!

#### 110 ####
Hey, granpa...
Let's bet on someone too.

#### 111 ####
No, betting's for losers.{enter}
I brought you here because
I want you to grow up and
be a strong man.{enter}
Strong enough to fight 
in the Tournament someday.

#### 112 ####
Man, how lame.

#### 113 ####
I come every year. This
is my third time. I only
have to see 'em once to
know who's the strongest.{enter}
Are you fighting?{wait:3C}
You look pretty strong.{wait:1E}
Um, maybe a semi-finalist.
Good luck.

#### 114 ####
If my guy wins...{wait:1E}
I'm going to the bar and
order the most expensive
whiskey they have.{enter}
Then I'm gonna ask that
waitress out! I wonder what
to get her for a present.

#### 115 ####
I'm betting on 
Big Joe too.

#### 116 ####
Trust me.
It's gonna be Big Joe.

#### 117 ####
I think Wiseman 
is stronger...

#### 118 ####
Who's sarge betting on?

#### 119 ####
Me I'm for Big Joe.

#### 120 ####
No way, bad choice.
He's all hot air.
Believe me, Wiseman's 
gonna win.

#### 121 ####
Shut up! I was right
last time, I'm not 
gonna listen to you.

#### 122 ####
Wow! You picked the champ
last time? You musta got
something like 50 to 1...

#### 123 ####
Yep and I blew it 
all in a week. 
Wah ha ha!

#### 124 ####
...What a waste.

#### 125 ####
Yep, that's the sarge. 
He's a man's man.

#### 126 ####
Recently the fighters have
been boring. It was better
when the King was around.

#### 127 ####
These martial arts
tournaments are okay...
But what if Gears, not
people, fought it out?
I'd like to see that.

#### 128 ####
Hey, are you for 
Joe too?

#### 129 ####
Big Joe's great 'cause
he's kinda shady.
Kids like you wouldn't
understand.

#### 130 ####
Wanna join Joe's fan club?
If you join, you can come
to our weekly coffee.{enter}
We have a dinner show
once a month too.

#### 131 ####
Hey are you fightin'?
Give it up. No way you 
can beat Joe.

#### 132 ####
I want to see what kind
of fighters came. The best
men all joined the army.

#### 133 ####
I love pure fighting.
Especially all those
different styles!{wait:3C} I came
all the way from Dazil.

#### 134 ####
I hate war and fighting.
What? Oh I'm writing a book
on the folly of mankind.
