Sigurd
"...I'll stay here a
little longer. I have
some thinking to do."

Sigurd
"Citan?
No, I haven't seen him...{enter}
You don't need to worry
about him. He'll be fine."

#### 4 ####
Sigurd
"Well, Marguerite, now that
we have saved you, may we
ask you one thing...?{enter}
Why did you go up against
the enemy by yourself?"

#### 5 ####
Sigurd
"Obviously a groundless
rumor started by the enemy
in order to lure you out."

#### 6 ####
Sigurd
"Marguerite..."

#### 7 ####
Sigurd
"Marguerite is straining
herself. Young master,
you should be kind to her."

Bart
"Then...{wait:18}you thought you
could save them alone!?
That was stupid!!"

#### 9 ####
Bart
"Margie!!"

#### 10 ####
Bart
"Next time, let us know!!
We'll go for you!"

Margie
"Sorry...but...
I heard a rumor in
town that day...{enter}
It was said that the
Sect's sisters who
were captured by Aveh
were still alive..."

#### 12 ####
Margie
"I believed it!
So what!?
I was wrong.{enter}
But..."

#### 13 ####
Margie
"But...grandma and mom
were already executed..."

#### 14 ####
Margie
"Sorry...{wait:20}to drag everybody
into this. I'll never do
it again..."

#### 15 ####
Margie
"Yeah...{wait:20}
I'll do that."

#### 16 ####
Maison
"Please, don't be
so hard on her...{enter}
The Nisan Sect is
Marguerite's home.
It's perfectly
understandable."

#### 17 ####
Maison
"At any rate, Marguerite
is here unhurt.
That's the main thing!{enter}
Before luck runs out,
let's take Marguerite
to Nisan. We can talk
more there.{enter}
Now, I'll go prepare
Marguerite's room...{wait:0A}
Miss Marguerite, may I
ask you to accompany me?"
