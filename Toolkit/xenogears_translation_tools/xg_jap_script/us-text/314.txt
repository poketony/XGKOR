Elly
"In short,{wait:05}
it's like this{wait:05}...{enter}
500 years ago, there was
a great war that occurred
between Solaris and the
land dwellers.{enter}
It's not clear what the
outcome was, but after the
war, Solaris feared another
land dweller revolt{wait:05}...{enter}
So Solaris built a 'Gate',{wait:05}
or barrier,{wait:05} that separates
Solaris' land from the
rest of the world's land.{enter}
The land dwellers who lived
within this Gate were made
to dwell as separate races
and were thus supervised.{enter}
To carry out the actual
supervision, Solaris
established the 'Ethos'.{enter}
So the 'Ethos' is actually
controlled by the 'Gazel
Ministry',{wait:05} or Solaris'
highest governmental body.{enter}
So,{wait:05} yes,{wait:05} the 'Ethos' is
really a 'front',{wait:05} or a
subsidiary organization,{wait:05}
working for Solaris!{enter}
Excavation findings, goods
and natural resources from
the surface are transported
to Solaris by the 'Ethos'.{enter}
This also includes 'human
resources', or people used
for manual labor and so on.{enter}
Basically, this here is the
window between the planet's
surface and Solaris up
there in the skies above.{enter}
According to these records,
there's been an enormous
amount of goods and people
tranferred to Solaris!"

#### 9 ####
Elly
"The rest is mainly about
population distribution
and excavation records.{enter}
The amount of detailed
information about races and
their biological data kind
of concerns me though..."

#### 10 ####
Elly
"There are facilities in
Solaris for accommodating
surface dwellers... I know!{enter}
The 3rd class citizen level

Isn't that what the

Citan
"This is the only plan
that is not linked to
Solaris...{enter}
It must have been
initiated by the 'Ethos'
itself, as a completely
independent project.{enter}
It was commenced about
... 19 years ago.{enter2}
Allow me to display
the data..."

#### 33 ####
Citan
"So, from this, it appears
that under Aquvy lies an
ultra-ancient civilization.{enter}
They have been doing a huge

obtained a vast quantity of

Hmm{wait:05}...{wait:05}I see, so this must

My assessment of the
circumstances is that the
'Ethos' is attempting to
break away from Solaris{wait:05}...{enter}
And once freed from its

attempt{wait:05} world
domination{wait:05} on its own."

#### 34 ####

"Attempt a breakaway{wait:05}...{wait:05}and
attempt world domination{wait:05}...{wait:05}
That's a rather ambitious!"

#### 35 ####

"Yes, but the real

are quite obvious{wait:05}...{enter}
The fact that they are
not reporting the results,{wait:05}

existence,{wait:05} gives it away{wait:05}...{enter}
The 'Ethos' is planning
to revolt by monopolizing
this ultra-advanced

Actually, such rebellions
have been quite common{wait:05}..."

#### 36 ####
Citan
"Yes, that is probably it.{enter2}
Shall we move along? There
could be more to find yet!"

#### 37 ####
Citan
"It is okay.{wait:0A} I have
adjusted the computer
to keep that lock open."

#### 38 ####
Bart
"The 'Ethos' data bank?"

#### 39 ####
Bart
"Anyway, this isn't
something we can just
check all on our own.{enter}
We should bring everyone
here we can."

#### 40 ####
Bart
"So that's it."

#### 41 ####
Bart
"Yeah, but even then{wait:05}...{wait:0A}
this place is damn well
equipped.{wait:0A} Look at it!"

#### 42 ####
Bart
"So, {wait:0A}Solaris!?"

#### 43 ####
Bart
"What's going on here?
What is this place?{enter}
Hey,{wait:0A} Billy!
You know anything
about this!?"

#### 44 ####
Bart
"Citan, what is that
being displayed there?"

#### 45 ####
Citan
"It looks like some
transmission record
from somewhere{wait:05}...{enter}
We might be able to
find some clues here.{wait:0A}
Wait one moment{wait:05}..."

#### 46 ####
Citan
"Alright...
Now I am able to transmit
it to the main displays."

#### 47 ####
Bart
"What the heck is this!?
Why's the 'Ethos' looking
into this kinda stuff?{enter}
On top of that,{fast:FF} that{wait:14}
{fast:00}Shakhan's a bishop!?{wait:1E} Wasn't
he excommunicated from the
'Ethos' 17 years ago!?"

#### 48 ####

over here too. {wait:0A}...{wait:0A}Huh?{enter}

I can't read this."

Bart
"C'mon, hurry up!"

#### 50 ####
Bart
"Huh?"

#### 51 ####
Bart
"So...{wait:14}
what does this
all mean?"

#### 52 ####
Bart
"Surely not all of them?{wait:0A}
What happened to the ones
that didn't become Etones?"

#### 53 ####
Billy
"Well{wait:0F}...{wait:0F}arrh{wait:0F}...?"

#### 54 ####
Bart
"It's all becoming
clear then, eh...{wait:0A}
How about it, Elly?"

#### 55 ####
Rico
"So this is the source
of their labor supply."

#### 56 ####
Billy
"Judging from our position,
this room is right under
the cathedral...{enter}
Which could mean that this
is the 'Ethos'{wait:0A} data bank?"

#### 57 ####
Billy
"This data bank holds all
the information concerning
the 'Ethos'.{enter}
From the past to the
present... everything!{wait:0A}
This facility is strictly
off limits to us.{enter}
Only the Bishop class
can ever enter this area."

#### 58 ####
Billy
"Don't ask me{wait:05}...{wait:0A}
How would I know{wait:05}...{wait:0A} This is
my first time in here{wait:05}...!"

#### 59 ####
Billy
"B, but, why would the
'Ethos' be sending
supplies to Solaris!?"

#### 60 ####
Billy
"This can't be!{wait:05}
I've heard nothing
of the sort!"

#### 61 ####
Billy
"They became Etones...
like me..."

#### 62 ####
Billy
"But that's impossible{wait:05}...!{wait:05}
How could that be{wait:05}..."

#### 63 ####
Billy
"Even{wait:05} if that was the case,{wait:05}
who would kill all those
'Ethos' people,{wait:05} and why!?"

#### 64 ####
Billy
"The 'Ethos'{wait:05}...{wait:05}
My 'Ethos'{wait:05}...{wait:05}
My faith{wait:05}...{wait:05}"

#### 65 ####
Bart
"Hey, Billy!{enter}
How long you plannin'
on being like that?
Get a hold of yourself!"

#### 66 ####
Citan
"This is all just
speculation based on
circumstantial evidence.{enter}
It would be best for you
to confirm what is the
truth with your own eyes."

#### 67 ####
Billy
"B, but, that door
is locked though..."

#### 68 ####
Rico
"Data bank?"

#### 69 ####
Rico
"Regardless, we can't
do this by ourselves.{enter}
Let's go get the rest
of the gang."

#### 70 ####
Rico
"Yeah, as I thought, huh."

#### 71 ####
Rico
"The 'Ethos' has been
assaulted by someone{wait:05}...{enter}
And in the basement{wait:05}...{wait:0A}
we find a Solarian
facility{wait:05}..."

#### 72 ####
Rico
"Then let's
investigate...!?"

#### 73 ####
Rico
"That can't be the case
if he's been sending in
regular reports."

#### 74 ####
Rico
"It's all a front!{enter}
The 'Ethos' is really a
subsidiary organization
of Solaris."

#### 75 ####
Rico
"So, the 'Ethos' has
been manipulating us, heh.{wait:14}
Anything else?"

#### 76 ####
Rico
"So what happened to all
those people you've seen
coming here for help?"

#### 77 ####
Elly
"We'll handle this here.{wait:0A}
You three should go on
further and investigate."

"Yes, that is probably it.{enter2}
Shall we move along? There
could be more to find yet!"

#### 115 ####
Citan
"It is okay. I have
adjusted the computer to
keep that lock open."

#### 116 ####
Bart
"But who would've guess
that Solaris was behind
the 'Ethos'?{enter}
Looks like there's more
than meets the eye with
this case."

#### 117 ####
Bart
"Yeah, so it seems...
This is a surprise."

#### 118 ####
Bart
"Yeah, but even then{wait:05}...{wait:0A}
this place is damn well
equipped.{wait:0A} Look at it!"

#### 119 ####
Bart
"So, {wait:0A}Solaris!?"

#### 120 ####
Bart
"What's going on here?
What is this place?{enter}
Hey,{wait:0A} Billy!
You know anything
about this!?"

#### 121 ####
Bart
"Citan, what is that
being displayed there?"

#### 122 ####
Citan
"It looks like some
transmission record
from somewhere{wait:05}...{enter}
We might be able to
find some clues here.{wait:0A}
Wait one moment{wait:05}..."

#### 123 ####
Citan
"Alright...
Now I am able to transmit
it to the main displays."

#### 124 ####
Bart
"What the heck is this!?
Why's the 'Ethos' looking
into this kinda stuff?{enter}
On top of that,{fast:FF} that{wait:14}
{fast:00}Shakhan's a bishop!?{wait:1E} Wasn't
he excommunicated from the
'Ethos' 17 years ago!?"

#### 125 ####
Bart
"There's a terminal switch
over here too.{wait:0A}
...{wait:0A}Huh?{enter}
What's with these letters?{wait:0A}
I can't read this."

#### 126 ####
Bart
"C'mon, hurry up!"

#### 127 ####
Bart
"Huh?"

#### 128 ####
Bart
"So...{wait:14}
what does this
all mean?"

#### 129 ####
Bart
"Surely not all of them?{wait:0A}
What happened to the ones
that didn't become Etones?"

#### 130 ####
Billy
"Well{wait:0F}...{wait:0F}arrh{wait:0F}...?"

#### 131 ####
Bart
"It's all becoming
clear then, eh...{wait:0A}
How about it, Elly?"

#### 132 ####
Rico
"So this is the source
of their labor supply."

#### 133 ####
Rico
"It's a strange feeling to
think our history may have
been directed by Solaris."

#### 134 ####
Rico
"Apparently."

#### 135 ####
Rico
"The 'Ethos' has been
assaulted by someone{wait:05}...{enter}
And in the basement{wait:05}...{wait:0A}
we find a Solarian
facility{wait:05}..."

#### 136 ####
Rico
"Then let's
investigate...!?"

#### 137 ####
Rico
"That can't be the case
if he's been sending in
regular reports."

#### 138 ####
Rico
"It's all a front!{enter}
The 'Ethos' is really a
subsidiary organization
of Solaris."

#### 139 ####
Rico
"So, the 'Ethos' has
been manipulating us, heh.{wait:14}
Anything else?"

#### 140 ####
Rico
"So what happened to all
those people you've seen
coming here for help?"
