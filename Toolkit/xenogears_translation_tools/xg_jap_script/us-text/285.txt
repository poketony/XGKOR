#### 5 ####
Ready? {clear:1E}

#### 6 ####
Start!

#### 7 ####
You thought I'd battle
right off? Get real!
Only the fast do well
at this game.
It's a card game for
'men of the sea'.

#### 8 ####
I'll explain the rules to you.
First I deal you and your
opponent 26 cards each.

#### 9 ####
Then I will place 4 cards
in front of each player
as your current hands.

#### 10 ####
And then, I place another
card on the left hand side
looking from your viewpoint.

#### 11 ####
Up to here I do automatically
for you. But from here on the
game starts.{enter}
You must take your first 4
cards and the remaining 21
cards and place them all on
top of the two center cards
faster than your opponent can.{enter}
Of course there are certain
rules for placing the cards.

#### 12 ####
Place a card on top of
another card if it is
numerically in order.
Like one number higher...

#### 13 ####
In this case, where there
is a 3 you can play a 4.

#### 14 ####
Or one number lower...

#### 15 ####
In this case, where there
is a 4 you can play a 3.

#### 16 ####
But if the numbers
aren't in order...

#### 17 ####
you can't play the card. But,
if there is a K (13) you can
play an A (1) and vice versa.

#### 18 ####
Now I'll teach you how
to control the cards.
First...{enter}
To move a card from your
deck into an empty position
in the hand of 4 cards in
front of you, use Left and
Right on the Directional
button to pick the position.{enter}
Then use either the
¡õ button, ¡÷ button,
L1 button, or R1 button
to place the card.

#### 19 ####
And to play a card, 
move on top of the card
you want to play...

#### 20 ####
And press the ¡÷ button
or R1 button to play on
the right...

#### 21 ####
Or press the ¡õ button
or L1 button to play on
the left.

#### 22 ####
Of course your opponent 
is also playing cards.

#### 23 ####
What if neither of you
can play a card, even
after replacing the set of
4 cards in front of you?{enter}
In this case there will be a
call of 'one-two', and a card
will be played directly from
your remaining pile of cards.

#### 24 ####
One-two

#### 25 ####
If both players still can't
play, this will be repeated.

#### 26 ####
If there are no remaining
cards on your pile to play
at the 'one-two' call...{enter}
then the left-most card from
the set of cards in front of
you will be played directly.

#### 27 ####
One-two

#### 28 ####
And...

#### 29 ####
The first player to use
up all their cards wins.
In this case you lose.

#### 30 ####
Oh, and one more thing.{enter}
By pushing the Select button,
you can quit a game midway
through. But of course this
will mean you lose.

#### 31 ####
By the way, there are
lots of good players
onboard the Thames.{enter}
How about starting off
by playing my mate here?
    Sure
    No thanks
