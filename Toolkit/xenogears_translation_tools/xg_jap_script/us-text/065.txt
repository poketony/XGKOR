"Wow...
I never thought we'd

Fei
"Where are we?"

Bart
"You see the twin
mountains way over there?{enter}
That's where Bledavik, the
Royal Capital of Aveh, and
Fatima Castle are located.{enter}
Currently, there's no king
living there though.{wait:14}
Anyway, that's my old home
town."

Fei
"Home town..."

Bart
"I'd like to go ahead and
settle our dispute but...{enter}
considering how close we
are to the capital of Aveh,
we'd probably get caught."

Bart
"Hey, stop looking so
glum, chum.{enter}
I guess I'll have to get
you back to your friend
soon or you'll die from
fretting or something.{enter}
Anyway, the rendezvous
point with the Yggdrasil
is right over there.{enter}
Don't worry, you'll be
meeting your friend in
no time at all."
