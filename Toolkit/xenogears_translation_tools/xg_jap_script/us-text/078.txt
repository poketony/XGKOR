#### 1 ####
Bart
"Are you ready?"

#### 2 ####
Bart
"I'll be waiting here,
so call me when you are
ready to go."

#### 3 ####
Sigurd
"The cave Shakhan is
heading for is directly
west of Nisan.{enter}
It's possible the
remainder of his forces
are gathering there."

#### 4 ####
Sigurd
"There's still some time
until we leave. Why don't
you make preparations?"

#### 5 ####
Sigurd
"I should have
been honest with
him sooner..."

#### 6 ####
Citan
"It is best not to
worry about it.{enter}
You did all you
could at the time.
The young one will
understand."

#### 7 ####
Maison
"I am sure the young
master would never have
dreamed of such a tale."

#### 8 ####
Fei
"...{wait:1E}I guess you
already knew?"

#### 9 ####
Maison
"Well, now that you ask...
yes I did.{enter}
However, when Sigurd was
telling his story I thought
it was best to stay quiet.{enter}
Please try and help the
young master come to terms
with all that he has just
heard."

#### 10 ####
Maison
"I have been waiting for
this day for a long time."

#### 11 ####
Margie
"Be careful."

#### 12 ####
Margie
"Bart told me.
You're helping out
with the plan too?{enter}
So you're caught up
in this now as well?"

#### 13 ####
Fei
"I've come this far,
so I might as well
stay till the end."

#### 14 ####
Margie
"Thanks.
I know you'll
do a good job!"

#### 15 ####
Agnes
"Be careful Bartholomew."

#### 16 ####
Agnes
"Marguerite and
Bartholomew...{enter}
I'm so happy to see
you two getting along
so well."

#### 17 ####
Margie
"Sister, please stop!{wait:1E}
You're embarrassing
me again."

#### 18 ####
Agnes
"It's not embarrassing.{enter}
Since long ago, the Nisan
Mother and King of Aveh
have always...

#### 19 ####
Margie
"Hey!{wait:1E}
Enough about this...{enter}
Hey...!{wait:1E}
Ouch ouch ouch!"

#### 20 ####
Bart
"Just sit still
like I said."

#### 21 ####
Margie
"Ohhhhh!{wait:1E}
You're a meanie!"

#### 22 ####
Sigurd!

#### 23 ####
Got it!

#### 24 ####
Elly
"I want to see the
gate's true shape."

#### 25 ####
Elly
"Let me come too?"
    Okay
    Sorry!

#### 26 ####
Citan
"Hmm...{wait:1E}
Actually, I would
also like to see it.{enter}
May I come along?{wait:1E}
I promise not to get
in the way."

#### 27 ####
Citan
"Exchange with me?"
    Sure
    No way

#### 28 ####
Rico
"This is Shakhan's last.{enter}
When he kick's the bucket
things in Kislev and Aveh
should calm down a little.{enter}
Everything'll be normal."

#### 29 ####
Rico
"I'm coming too, okay?"
    Great!
    Well...

#### 30 ####
Billy
"The 'Ethos' was
controlling two of
the three gates!"

#### 31 ####
"Will you take me
along too?"
    Alright!
    Sorry, but...

#### 32 ####
Maria
"Soon we'll be certain
of the gate's true form."

#### 33 ####
Maria
"Do you want to change?"
    Please
    That's okay

#### 34 ####
{name:07:チュチュ}
"{name:07:チュチュ} is raring chu 
go like a big bonfire!{enter}
Fei, I'll protect chu
anywhere, in the heart
of a fire or under the
sea chu!"

#### 35 ####
{name:07:チュチュ}
"So I wanna go chu!"
    I guess it's okay
    Sorry!

#### 36 ####
Traveling?
Surely it is tiring.{enter}
You're going to that inn?
I'm sure they'll have good
food for you.

#### 37 ####
We work in the cathedral
over there.

#### 38 ####
Fei
"...So you're sisters?"

#### 39 ####
Yes, that is correct.{enter}
We are wandering the land...{enter}
searching for the
connection between Nisan
and the outside world.

#### 40 ####
Sigurd
"Whenever I come here it
always calms my heart."

#### 41 ####
Sigurd
"Anyway, young master{wait:05}...{wait:05}
I want to work out what our
plans from here on are."

#### 42 ####
Bart
"Alright.{enter}
But before we do that...
there is something I want
to ask you."

#### 43 ####
Sigurd
"...Me?"

#### 44 ####
Bart
"Yeah."

#### 45 ####
Bart
"Sig...{enter}
What's up with you and
that Gebler officer?
What's the connection
between you and him...?{enter}
You know,{wait:1E} you sure know
a lot about Gebler for
some reason!"

#### 46 ####
Sigurd
"...Alright.
{wait:1E}I'll tell you."

#### 47 ####
Sigurd
"Me and...{wait:1E}
Citan, here...{enter}
We used to live
in Solaris."

#### 48 ####
Bart
"Solaris...{enter}
...{wait:1E}You mean...
{wait:1E}where Gebler's from?"

#### 49 ####
Sigurd
"That's right."

#### 50 ####
Sigurd
"Solaris...
calls foreigners
'Lambs'...{enter}
They are used as manual
labor. Basically it's
slavery."

#### 51 ####
Bart
"Slavery?"

#### 52 ####
Fei
"...Lambs..."

#### 53 ####
Fei
"Elly used that
term earlier too."

#### 54 ####
Bart
"Is that where
you met him?"

#### 55 ####
Citan
"Yes, it was there."

#### 56 ####
Sigurd
"We worked for the
Solaris government
for a short while...{enter}
But we learned to
dislike their methods
and escaped the first
chance we had."

#### 57 ####
Bart
"...{wait:1E}You were
friends with
these people?"

#### 58 ####
Bart
"I met you when I was a kid
and we've been together
ever since then...{enter}
So this would have had to
have happened even before
then."

#### 59 ####
Bart
"I probably wouldn't have
understood this if I had
heard it earlier but...{enter}
...Why didn't you think I
could deal with it now?
Surely you could have
told me about this?{enter}
Especially when you had
something to do with the
people who are backing
that Shakhan idiot!"

#### 60 ####
Bart
"I wish you'd
told me sooner."

#### 61 ####
Sigurd
"...{wait:1E}There's nothing I
can do about that now."

#### 62 ####
Sigurd
"But, there's one thing
I want you to believe...{enter}
We left Solaris on our
own will and for our own
reasons.{enter}
Now they've appeared
before us, we can't
just sit back and do
nothing.{enter}
If need be, I will give
my life to stop them."

#### 63 ####
Bart
"Alright, I understand.{wait:0A}
But can you elaborate
a little more?"

#### 64 ####
    Where is Solaris?
    What are Lambs?
    Who is that man?
    Why did you leave?

#### 65 ####
    Ask again
    I understand

#### 66 ####
Bart
"What bugs me is this{wait:1E}
'Surface Dwellers'
thing...{enter}
It's as if Solaris is
in another location.
Like up in the clouds
or something?"

#### 67 ####
Sigurd
"Yes, well..."

#### 68 ####
Sigurd
"The city of Solaris is
covered by a giant dome.{enter}
And guessing from the
scenery that's visible,
I think it's somewhere
up high in the sky."

#### 69 ####
Bart
"You think...{wait:1E}
Didn't you live there?"

#### 70 ####
Sigurd
"It's completely cut off
from the outside world so
I don't know too well.{enter}
There's a special way to
get there from the surface."

#### 71 ####
Sigurd
"To get to Aveh we stowed
away on a regular flight
to the surface."

#### 72 ####
Citan
"I came much later
than Sigurd did...{enter}
But I also escaped
in the same way."

#### 73 ####
Sigurd
"That is the word Solarians
use to indicate those who
live on the earth.{enter}
As I said before, such
'surface dwellers' or
'earth dwellers' are used
for manual labor there."

#### 74 ####
Sigurd
"Manual labor could be
anything from soldiers to
administrative jobs.{enter}
Solaris gathers its
workforce from the land
dwellers. Jobs are divided
up by who is most suitable.{enter}
Sometimes people are
brainwashed."

#### 75 ####
Bart
"Brainwashed!?"

#### 76 ####
Sigurd
"I...{wait:05}
When you, young master,
were still an infant...{enter}
I was used as a test
subject. There was
probably something they
valued inside of me."

#### 77 ####
Fei
"You too, doc?"

#### 78 ####
Citan
"No...{enter}
I was born in the lower
city levels. It is not
a complete secret...{enter}
But I guess I am a
Solarian{wait:05}..."

#### 79 ####
Bart
"So why were you collecting
people? {enter}
With that much scientific
technology you'd think they
wouldn't need to use
people..."

#### 80 ####
Citan
"You see{wait:05}...{wait:05}
You still need people
to run a country{wait:05}...{enter}
...{wait:05}No matter how
scientifically advanced
you are, you have no
support without people."

#### 81 ####
Sigurd
"Pure Solarians are rare.{enter}
They would not even make
up a quarter of Aveh's
total population.{enter}
So, they support their
country by stealing
surface dwellers."

#### 82 ####
Sigurd
"His name is, Kahr...
{wait:1E}Kahran Ramsus.{enter}
As you know he's the
Gebler Commander."

#### 83 ####
Bart
"Ramsus...?"

#### 84 ####
Sigurd
"We call him Kahr.{enter}
In Solaris there is an
officer training school
called 'Jugend'.{enter}
He became the commander
after leaving there."

#### 85 ####
Citan
"He is a lower level
citizen, the same as me.{enter}
However, with his amazing
abilities...{enter}
After graduating, he rose
through the ranks with
unparalleled speed."

#### 86 ####
Sigurd
"That man had one ideal.{enter}
To achieve a consolidation
of all his colleagues.{enter}
Even land dwellers, if they
had talent, were brought
into the army."

#### 87 ####
Bart
"So you two were
picked by Ramsus...?"

#### 88 ####
Citan
"No,{wait:05} we were not picked
by him{wait:05}...{wait:05}we aligned
ourselves with him."

#### 89 ####
Sigurd
"At that time{wait:05}...{wait:05}
we agreed with him."

#### 90 ####
Citan
"At the time,
Ramsus was our hope.{enter}
He had high ideals and
wanted to change the
system in Solaris.{enter}
To us test subjects and
lower level citizens,
he was truly all that
we wished for."

#### 91 ####
Bart
"A benefactor?"

#### 92 ####
Sigurd
"Yes...{wait:1E}even I, a test
subject, was changed
by his ideals."

#### 93 ####
Bart
"So why was it that
you wanted to flee
from Solaris?"

#### 94 ####
Sigurd
"We were placed in key
military positions by
Ramsus...{enter}
And thanks to that, we came
to know the relationship
between Solaris and the
surface dwellers."

#### 95 ####
Bart
"You mean...Lambs...?"

#### 96 ####
Sigurd
"They weren't just using us
'Lambs' for slave labor...{enter}
They also selected some of
us, like me, to be used as
subjects in experiments to
refine their drugs...{enter}
Drugs that change people's
personalities, to make them
more aggressive and to draw
out their latent abilities.{enter}
They were using us as human
guinea pigs to test their
psychological alteration
drugs!"

#### 97 ####
Bart
"Human guinea pigs...!?
Experimenting on humans?"

#### 98 ####
Sigurd
"Yes, for example...
'Drive'!{enter}
That drug, and all others
like it that are used
now, are by-products of
human experimentation..."

#### 99 ####
Citan
"However that is not the
test subjects only role."

#### 100 ####
Fei
"This 'Drive' drug is
something that anyone in
the Solaris army can use?"

#### 101 ####
Citan
"At least anyone in the
Gebler forces who is sent
to the surface..."

#### 102 ####
Bart
"You're worried
about her, huh?"

#### 103 ####
Fei
"...!"

#### 104 ####
Bart
"I saw some{wait:05}...{wait:05}
in her room."

#### 105 ####
Fei
"No..."

#### 106 ####
Bart
"...{wait:05}Anyway{wait:05}...{wait:05}using slaves
as guinea pigs{wait:05}...{wait:05}
How low are these guys{wait:05}...?"

#### 107 ####
Bart
"Hmm...{wait:1E}I think I
get most of it."

#### 108 ####
Bart
"Old Maison!{enter}
Go reserve the town
hall for us. We'll
finish talking there.{enter}
I'm going outside to
get some air."

#### 109 ####
Sigurd
"To get to Aveh we stowed
away on a regular flight
to the surface."

#### 110 ####
Citan
"I came much later
than Sigurd did...{enter}
But I also escaped
in the same way."

#### 111 ####
Fei
"This 'Drive' drug is
something that anyone in
the Solaris army can use?"

#### 112 ####
Citan
"At least anyone in the
Gebler forces who is sent
to the surface..."

#### 113 ####
Bart
"You're worried
about her, huh?"

#### 114 ####
Fei
"...!"

#### 115 ####
Bart
"I saw some{wait:05}...{wait:05}
in her room."

#### 116 ####
Fei
"No..."

#### 117 ####
Bart
"...{wait:05}Anyway{wait:05}...{wait:05}using slaves
as guinea pigs{wait:05}...{wait:05}
How low are these guys{wait:05}...?"

#### 118 ####
Bart
"Damn!"

#### 119 ####
Margie
"Good morning!"

#### 120 ####
Margie
"What's with the long
face? Not feeling well?{enter}
Or are you feeling sad
about saying goodbye?
Or maybe you're just
nervous?"

#### 121 ####
Bart
"Shut up, stupid!
Don't bug me!"

#### 122 ####
Margie
"Hee hee."

#### 123 ####
Margie
"Well...
It's almost time."

#### 124 ####
Bart
"Yeah, yeah..."

#### 125 ####
Bart
"Is everyone ready to go?{enter}
I'll be waiting here,
so let me know when you
are through preparing."

#### 126 ####
Bart
"No activites for you.{wait:1E}
You'll have to settle
down for awhile."

#### 127 ####
Margie
"What do you mean,
once in awhile?"

#### 128 ####
Bart
"Don't get so excited.{wait:1E}
Ha ha ha ha!"

#### 129 ####
Margie
"Meanie!"

#### 130 ####
Sigurd
"...{wait:1E}Alright.{enter}
Please tell Maison we'll
be here a while longer."

#### 131 ####
Sigurd
"We've heard from our
units in Bledavik.{enter}
Things are unfolding
smoothly.
They have entered the
castle.{enter}
They are investigating
Shakhan's private room
on the top floor of the
castle.{enter}
One more thing, {wait:1E}Yggdrasil
is on station nearby and
has picked up several
Gears on radar."

#### 132 ####
Bart
"Shakhan!"

#### 133 ####
Sigurd
"Most certainly.{enter}
But those Gears went to
the capital then turned
and came back toward us."

#### 134 ####
Fei
"He saw things weren't
looking too good and
ran away."

#### 135 ####
Bart
"Yeah.{wait:1E}
But it sounds like he's
coming back here."

#### 136 ####
Fei
"What's here...?"

#### 137 ####
Sigurd
"About that,{wait:1E}
the info from the
capital...{enter}
Isn't there a -Gate-
in the area?"

#### 138 ####
Fei
"A -Gate-?"

#### 139 ####
Citan
"Where?"

#### 140 ####
Sigurd
"Directly west of Nisan."

#### 141 ####
Sigurd
"Young master, do you know
the big cave over there?"

#### 142 ####
Bart
"Cave...{wait:1E}
On the western continent?
It's near the ocean.{enter}
If I remember it's big
enough for a Gear to walk
into."

#### 143 ####
Sigurd
"Yes, there.{enter}
They found evidence that
there is some large
building inside that cave."

#### 144 ####
Fei
"Shakhan is heading for
there..."

#### 145 ####
Fei
"What's he doing?"

#### 146 ####
Bart
"I guess we'll have
to go and see!"

#### 147 ####
Fei
"Okay!"

#### 148 ####
Sigurd
"I'll wait here for
info from the capital."

#### 149 ####
Citan
"A gate!{enter}
Of course I would like to
actually see it...{wait:1E}but this
time I will pass.{enter}
There are two more left...
And besides...{enter}
Just in case things do not
go well, it might be better
if we stay here and protect
Marguerite."

#### 150 ####
Bart
"Got it.{wait:1E}
I leave the rest to you!"

#### 151 ####
    Alright!
    Not yet.
