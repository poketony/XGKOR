#### 1 ####
What am I doing?
...huff...{wait:1E}puff...

#### 2 ####
Can't you tell!?
...huff...{wait:1E}puff...

#### 3 ####
I'm working out.
...huff...{wait:1E}puff...

#### 4 ####
Gonna kick Solaris' butt.
...huff...{wait:1E}puff...

#### 5 ####
I have to get pumped up.
...huff...{wait:1E}puff...

#### 6 ####
It's all over for them.
...huff...{wait:1E}puff...

#### 7 ####

"   Down with Solaris!!
     The world is ours!{wait:14}
 
 But before all that...{wait:28}{fast:FF}
   No gambling!
   No heavy drinking!
   Meet the deadlines
   Never give up!
   Take a bath!
   Don't listen to cry babies!
   Attend every morning!
   No unplanned trips!
   Keep the ocean clean!"

#### 13 ####
Hey, haven't seen you
before. You new?{wait:14}
Welcome to the Shevat
Liberation barracks!!{enter}
...But in actuality, we
aren't as glorious as the
name may suggest.{wait:14} Hahaha...{enter}
But it is true that this
is the barracks for the
anti-Solaris troops.{wait:14} Think
of this as home and relax.

#### 14 ####
But...we're in an odd
situation.{enter}
We're picking a fight with
an organization that has
the power to manipulate
the world from the shadows.

#### 15 ####
Heh, and to think we're
all just a motley crew of
rioters from the land
below.{enter}
We're just a bunch of 
people who've lived most of
our lives without knowing 
the existence of Shevat or
Solaris...{enter}
Come to think of it, 
it almost sounds like a
joke.

#### 16 ####
So where did you fellas
come from? From the looks
of it, I'd guess you're
from the Ignas continent.{enter}
Were you saved by the people
here too?{wait:14} I understand. We 
were all in the same
situation.{enter}
Everyone's got their unique
story on how they got
involved in this fiasco with
the Gebler and the 'Ethos'
and all.{enter}
The usual pattern here is
that many of the people were
almost eliminated for some 
reason they don't know but 
were saved by the people here
before they were doomed.

#### 17 ####
That's basically it.{wait:14} 
From now on we're all on
the same boat. {wait:14}
Welcome aboard!

#### 18 ####
Back in Kislev, I used
to deal with homemade
medicines.{enter}
By the way, I've heard 
rumors that the enemy
has some really cool
medicines.{enter}
I wanted to learn some of
those techniques, so I
snuck into their shop
but...{wait:14}I was a little
clumsy...heh.

#### 19 ####
I got desperate and somehow
managed to escape, and make
my way to Thames - the city
I had heard stories about.{wait:14}
That's where the good people
here picked me up.{enter}
If they hadn't picked me up
then, without a doubt, I 
would've been a guinea pig 
for their experimental 
drugs...{wait:14}
Because I'm so cute.

#### 20 ####
Yeah!{wait:14} Even if I were to
have returned back to the
land, they would probably
try to capture me again.{enter}
It wouldn't matter how
many lives I had, it still
wouldn't be enough.{enter}
So I've decided to stick
around here.
That's probably the case
for the majority of the
people here.

#### 21 ####
And anyway, don't you wanna
make the bad guys pay for
it?{wait:14} They gotta be crazy if
they think we'll just take
this lying down!

#### 22 ####
Yo, this house is basically
an apartment for us land
dwellers that were saved.{enter}
I've heard that there
aren't that many pure
Shevites in this town
anymore.{enter}
Basically, it's been said
that a majority of them
were lost in that war with
Solaris 500 years ago.

#### 23 ####
Well, if we're not careful
ourselves, our fates may
be similar too. Heh.

#### 24 ####
Ha...{clear:0A}

#### 25 ####
Yeah, they say this city used
to be like any other city 
when it was on the ground 
500 years ago.{enter}
But after losing to Solaris, 
they launched just the 
palace block of the city up 
into the sky.{enter}
It's basically an unbelievable
story, but in reality we're 
riding on that part of the 
city, and floating out in the
sky right now.{enter}
In life, you never know what
to expect.

#### 26 ####
This is just between you and
me but, I am the one and 
only hope for Shevat.
I am the secret agent man...{wait:14}
In other words, I'm a spy!{enter}
Well? Ain't I cool?{wait:14}
...But, come to think of it,
if you're here too, you 
guys are probably no
different than me...sigh...

#### 27 ####
Have you already met with
Queen Zephyr?{wait:14} A very nice
person she is.{enter}
We are all able to live
like this because the
Queen saved us.

#### 28 ####
That large white statue of
an angel at the entrance 
of the palace is a 
representation of a
particular woman who
sacrificed herself in that
war 500 years ago.{enter}
It's so sad.{wait:14} She was probably
the beloved heroine of
the rebellion back then.
