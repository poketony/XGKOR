Fei
"I don't know how...{wait:1E}
but I beat them!"

#### 2 ####
Fei
"W, what the?"

#### 3 ####
Fei
"You're the one from...{wait:28}
Lahan...!!"

#### 4 ####
Fei
"How much power I had?
What are you talking
about!"

#### 5 ####
Fei
"To get me in that Gear!?
It was planned by you!?"

#### 6 ####
Fei
"As a catalyst!?
You mean you caused
that intentionally!?"

#### 7 ####
Fei
"Crap..."

#### 8 ####
Fei
"You said you need my
power? What were you
intending to do with it!?"

#### 9 ####
Fei
"What did you do to my
father!? What happened
between you two!?"

#### 10 ####
Fei
"What!?"

#### 11 ####
Fei
"W, wait!
We're not finished
talking yet!!"

#### 12 ####
Fei
"You mean you attacked my
village just to get me in
that Gear!? {enter}
Why!?{wait:14}
Why did the villagers
have to die...?"

#### 13 ####
Fei
"No!!{wait:1E}
I was just trying to save
the village and its people!{enter}
I never intended to destroy
it!!"

#### 14 ####
Fei
"Shut up!{enter}
Even if that were
true, aren't you
still the one who
caused it!?{enter}
If you hadn't come,
the village wouldn't
have suffered the
way it did!"

#### 15 ####
Fei
"D, destroy god?"

#### 16 ####
Fei
"Don't be ridiculous!
I won't get involved
in such a thing!{enter}
If you want to destroy
your god, or whatever
it is you're on about...
do it by yourself!!"

#### 17 ####
Fei
"My father?{wait:19}
You mean my dad?{wait:1E}
You know my father!?"

#### 18 ####
Fei
"What?"

#### 19 ####
Citan
"Here we go again..."

#### 20 ####
Man In Black
"Your hot blooded desire
for battle has not been
tamed, I see."

#### 21 ####
Man In Black
"My name is {wait:0A}Grahf{wait:0A}...{wait:0A}
The seeker of power.{enter}
You certainly showed how
much power you had back
there in Lahan, didn't
you, Fei!?"

#### 22 ####
Grahf
"A greater power...
is what I need to
fulfill my mission.{enter}
I sent those Gears into
that land as a catalyst to 
awaken the power in you...
To make contact with you."

#### 23 ####
Grahf
"Yes.{wait:0A}
A catalyst was needed
to awaken your power."

#### 24 ####
Grahf
"That's right.{wait:0A}
The death of your loved
ones...{enter}
And you powerless against
it happening...{wait:0A} The grief,{wait:0A}
the screams from your heart
born out of the tragedy...{enter}
There!{wait:0A}
That was the catalyst for
triggering your power."

#### 25 ####
Grahf
"Who cares why!
It does not matter how
many of them died...{enter}
They were wretched vermin,
only living from day to day
without ever fulfilling
their prescribed destinies!{enter}
And have you forgotten?{wait:0A}
You were the one who
destroyed the village.{wait:0A}
I did not lift a finger."

#### 26 ####
Grahf
"Is that really so?{wait:0F}
Surely you have heard it?{enter}
It is the very essence of
you...the voice of desire
from within you that
craves destruction."

#### 27 ####
Grahf
"Ah, so now you resort
to blame? I see...{enter}
That sounds like something
'you' would say.
That's good. Your basic
nature remains unchanged."

#### 28 ####
Grahf
"You know very well...{wait:0A}
It is to destroy...{wait:1E}
mother {wait:0A}god{wait:0A}..."

#### 29 ####
Grahf
"Yes, we will destroy god.
That is our purpose...
That is our destiny!"

#### 30 ####
Grahf
"Hah, hah, hah...
You resemble your
father."

#### 31 ####
Grahf
"That was...
a most delightful scream.
I was enthralled by it.{enter}
Nothing is more beautiful
than a scream of death."

#### 32 ####
Grahf
"Hmph, do you really wish
to know? There is no use
in you knowing it now."

#### 33 ####
Grahf
"Your power is still
beneath that needed
for my purposes.{enter}
Anything unusable
must be tried until
it becomes suitable."

#### 34 ####
Grahf
"What will you do, Fei?
If you die here, then
so be it.{enter}
You may indeed gain some
happiness from not knowing.
But surely, that is not
what you truly want...?{enter}
If you want to know the
truth...and that is what
you want, isn't it Fei...
then this is what to do...{enter}
You must show me that you
have attained the level of
strength I require...{enter}
To do that you must destroy
others by using your own
strength!{enter}
Then you will gain all
that was lost in exchange
for that scream of death!{wait:0F}
Ha, ha, ha, ha!!"

#### 35 ####
HA, HA, HA, HA, HA!

#### 36 ####
Fei
"!!
What in hell
is that!?"
