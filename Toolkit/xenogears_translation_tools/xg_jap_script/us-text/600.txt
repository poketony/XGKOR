"Ghaah!"

Billy
"Sh, she took my gun...!?"

Bart
"W, why did
you do that,{wait:14}
Elly...?"

#### 4 ####
Citan
"Elly!?{wait:14}
What happened to you!?{wait:14}
How could you!?"

#### 5 ####
Bart
"Don't tell me
she's been{wait:05}...{wait:05}
brainwashed!?"

#### 6 ####
Krelian
"It has nothing to do
with brainwashing..."

#### 7 ####
Citan
"Unify with
the mother...?"

#### 8 ####
Krelian
"That girl{wait:05}...{wait:05}Elhaym,
is our 'mother'."

#### 9 ####
Elly
"Yes.
I am the mother of
all humans..."

#### 10 ####
Fei
"Elly...!?"

#### 11 ####
Bart
"What are you babbling
on about!?{wait:14}
Snap out of it, Elly!!"

#### 12 ####
Elly
"You're as dense as
usual...{wait:14} But, I don't
blame you...{enter}
So be it.
I will explain to
you all about it."

#### 13 ####
Elly
"This Deus, the one you call
god, is an 'inter-planetary
invasion weapon system' that
was built in ancient times by
humans from another planet.{enter}
It was created as an automatic
weapon which could act upon
its own will to take control
of a targeted planet.{wait:14} But you
should've known this much from
looking at the Razael records.{enter}
Anyway, during a test run,
Deus became uncontrollable.
It released its power and
annihilated a whole planet.{enter}
The creators of 'Deus' found
its immeasurable power to be
too much of a threat and hence
forcibly shut it down.{enter}
In order to analyze the cause
of the problem, its core was
dismantled and placed on an
inter-planetary emigrant
passenger ship to be
transported to another planet.{enter}
Becoming aware of this, the
dissasembled Deus resisted.
It tried to  take over the
passenger ship that was
transporting it.{enter}
However, as a last line of
defense against the escape
of Deus, its creators,
unexpectedly destroyed the
whole ship, sending it
crashing to this planet.{enter}
Deus knew that it would not
be able to get away from the
explosion or the imminent
impact and so it detached its
core from the 'Zohar' power
reactor."

#### 14 ####
Fei
"Zo...har...?"

#### 15 ####
Elly
"Yes, 'Zohar'...
It is what drives all of
the Gears on this planet.{enter}
It is the master generator
that transmits its energy
to the slave generators
in our Gears.{enter}
It is also the source of
all the Ether power that
the inhabitants of this
planet utilize.{enter}
By utilizing the energy
displacements caused by
actualizing potential
future phenomenon...{enter}
...this 'Zohar Modifier'
has the ability to produce
infinite amounts of
energy."

#### 16 ####
Bart
"The source of all
our Ether power!?"

#### 17 ####
Citan
"Are you saying all our
energy comes from that one
power reactor or engine?"

#### 18 ####
Elly
"Yes, but there is more...{enter}
The core that was detached 
from Zohar, the 'Biological
Computer Kadomony' crashed
onto this primitive planet.{enter}
It activated -Persona-,
its life support plant,
that can generate organic
material.{enter}
Using this it prepared for
itself a genetic-based
system for the day when
Deus would be resurrected.{enter}
Thus, the first humans were
created from there...{wait:14}
Emperor Cain and the elders
of the Gazel Ministry."

#### 19 ####
Rico
"Are you saying the Emperor
and them Gazel geezers were
people born from Deus!?"

#### 20 ####
Elly
"Do you know why the Gazel
Ministry desired the Anima
Relics and your bodies?{wait:0A}
Well, here's the reason...{enter}
Before becoming human, the
bodies of the Ministry were
once part of the organic
elements in the core circuit
that made up 'Deus'.{enter}
There were two types of
organic elements.
The female type was called
'Anima', while the male
type was called 'Animus'.{enter}
They were also created with
the added ability to become
mobile weapons by merging
with machinery that was
suited for use as terminal
interface weapons for Deus.{enter}
In other words, those
Omnigears you were using
were one form of such
weapons.{enter}
The Ministry, which were
Animus, were to become one
again with their separated
Anima at the time of the
resurrection of god...{enter}
But, in a war 500 years ago,
they all lost their physical
bodies.{enter}
It was then that they
decided to extract their own
genetic factor from certain
individuals of their human
descendants who carried the
appropriate sets of D.N.A..{enter}
All so each of them could
become one with their
respective Anima again."

#### 21 ####
Maria
"Descendants!?"

#### 22 ####
Bart
"Then we're all...!?"

#### 23 ####
Elly
"Yes, you humans are all
descendants of Cain and
the Gazel Ministry...{enter}
They were born from the
-Persona-, gave birth,
and propagated.{enter}
They followed their
inbuilt program to
someday resurrect the
heavily damaged Deus."

#### 24 ####
Citan
"All the people in the
world were created solely
to resurrect Deus!?"

#### 25 ####
Elly
"Yes.{wait:14}
But it wasn't just to
restore its old body.{enter}
More than half of Deus is
constructed of biological
parts.{wait:14} Do you remember
those mutated humans?{enter}
Those are all people who
were destined to become
replacement parts for
Deus."

#### 26 ####
Billy
"We humans are...{wait:14}
parts for god..."

#### 27 ####
Elly
"Yes, almost all the
people are destined to
become parts for Deus.{enter}
But you people gathered
here are all different.{enter}
You could say...you
escaped that destiny by
existing through multiple
generations...{enter}
In actuality, there wasn't
enough parts for Deus...{wait:14}
But, Krelian compensated
for what was lacking.{enter}
The reduction in the number
of parts, was due to humans
living through multiple
generations...{enter}
But that deficiency in the
human factor, was made up
for by the nanomachines
created by Krelian.{enter}
Not only that, but his
nanomachines added
additional functions.{enter}
Deus has thus evolved into
the perfect weapon.

#### 28 ####
Fei
"Elly{wait:05}...{enter}
What has happened{wait:05}...?{wait:14}
Why{wait:05}...{wait:05}do you know
all{wait:05}...{wait:05}that{wait:05}...?"

#### 29 ####
Elly
"I am Miang.{wait:14} The keeper of
time.{wait:14} The representative of
our god -Deus-.{enter}
I was born to guide the
people toward the path of
the resurrection of Deus."

#### 30 ####
Bart
"That's ridiculous!{wait:14}
Miang was just..."

#### 31 ####
Elly
"You're limited in your
ability to understand...{enter}
Miang's factor exists
within all women.{enter}
The one who trascends the
generations, the caretaker
of humans.{enter}
When the previous one dies,
somewhere another Miang is
awakened.{enter}
It is programmed into all
womens' DNA to be that way.{enter}
Who inherits the duty is
just a matter of
probability, Fei.{enter}
That Miang over there and
I are the same existence.{wait:14} 
We are all parts of Deus...
All caretakers of humans."

#### 32 ####
Elly
"Let us end this
discussion now.{wait:14} 
Deus has awakened.{enter}
I am one of the parts
that composes Deus.{wait:14}
Hence, I must become
one with it."

#### 33 ####
Citan
"Elly!{wait:14}
Why did it have to be
you?{enter}
If Miang is a part for
Deus, why did it not
happen earlier...?"

#### 34 ####
Krelian
"It's still not enough
for her just to have
awakened.{enter}
Although she may be
Miang, she still isn't
the 'true Miang'."

#### 35 ####
Citan
"The 'true Miang'...?"

#### 36 ####
Elly
"Let's go, Krelian.{enter}
All that is left to do is
to vanquish this planet's
civilization and return
it to how it was.{enter}
Then I can complete my
unification with the
final fragment of Deus...
the 'Zohar Modifier'...{enter}
The power reactor that
fell upon this planet and
became our genesis, and
now, our apocalypse..."

#### 37 ####
Citan
"The eradication of
civilization!?{enter}
What is the purpose
of doing that!?"

#### 38 ####
Elly
"Who knows...?{wait:14}
The creations of god will
someday be a hindrance.{enter}
That is why they must be
eliminated.{wait:14}
I am just programmed to
act in this way..."

#### 39 ####
Krelian
"Come...{enter}
It is time for
the awakening of
the true 'mother'."

#### 40 ####
Fei
"Please{wait:05}...{wait:05}
wait{wait:05}...{wait:14}
Elly{wait:05}...!"

#### 41 ####
Elly
"Farewell{wait:05}...{wait:05}Fei.{wait:14}
May you have a peaceful
'awakening'{wait:05}..."

#### 42 ####
Citan
"Fei!{wait:14}
Now you hang
in there!"

#### 43 ####
Krelian
"The majority of my
body is comprised of
a nanomahine colony.{enter}
Not only for longevity
{wait:05}...{wait:05}but also to unify
with the 'mother'{wait:05}...{enter}
So don't be surprised.
This much damage can
be recovered rather
quickly."
