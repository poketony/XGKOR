"Both Aveh and Kislev are
devoted to excavating the
ruins.{enter}
Each country's strength
is increasing daily.{enter}
Even if we could get the
help of all our comrades
to start a revolution...{enter}
...the combined strength
of all of us would still
not be enough.{enter}
We would certainly be
suppressed by Shakhan's
guards in no time at all."

We needed power.{enter}
We tried excavating the
ruins using the Yggdrasil
but it didn't work as

Excavating requires
tremendous amounts of
time, labor and capital.{enter}
The best we can do with
our sand cruiser is find
small items in the sand.
