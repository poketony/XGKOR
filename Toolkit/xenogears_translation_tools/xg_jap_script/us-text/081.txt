"These are the Gebler 
units currently in Aveh, 
correct?"

#### 2 ####
Citan
"The western guards..."

#### 3 ####
Citan
"the Royal Capital
defense force..."

#### 4 ####
Citan
"and...{wait:1E}units along
the front line at the
border with Kislev."

#### 5 ####
Citan
"There are three main
groups.{enter}
Each is made up of a
mix of Gebler and Aveh
forces. Only two of
these are very large."

#### 6 ####
Citan
"The Royal Capital's
defense units and the
Kislev border units.{enter}
The western guard along
Nisan's border are little
more than a surveillence
team."

#### 7 ####
Sigurd
"In order to recapture
the Royal Capital...{enter}
...it will be necessary
to draw these defense
units away from Bledavik."

#### 8 ####
Citan
"We have some Kislev
made Gears, correct?"

#### 9 ####
Bart
"Yeah, we captured 
some earlier."

#### 10 ####
Citan
"What if we use those
Gears to make a raid on
the western guards...{enter}
...here at the border
with Nisan?"

#### 11 ####
Bart
"I see. We'll draw them
out by making it look like
Kislev is invading Aveh."

#### 12 ####
Citan
"The main strength of
Aveh's fleet is the
battleship Kefeinzel.{enter}
It's been in service
since the reign of
the last king.{enter}
Because of its fire-
power, the whole unit
is nicknamed the
'invincible fleet'.{enter}
I recall yesterday's
intelligence report
said that the ship
is near the border."

#### 13 ####
Sigurd
"Well, now that we know
what we are up against,
here's what we'll do..."

#### 14 ####
Sigurd
"Apart from our main unit
heading for Bledavik...{enter}
we must keep the fleet
at the Kislev border from
returning to the capital."

#### 15 ####
Bart
"So you're suggesting
we have another unit?"

#### 16 ####
Citan
"A few effective soldiers
to hold the enemy at bay...
A small force is best."

#### 17 ####
Sigurd
"A small force...?"

#### 18 ####
Citan
"What if Fei leads a
group of Gears there?"
