Boy is that guy quick at

Around here should be

"The meeting place was the

Well then, let us go!"

My big sister has her heart
set on a someone{wait:05}...{wait:0F}
She thinks he'll come back
one day{wait:05}...{wait:05} so she keeps
waiting and waiting and{wait:05}...

#### 15 ####
Children should play outside
for their own health. That's
common thinking{wait:05}...{wait:05} right!?{enter}
But in this town, covered in
dirty steam, it's probably
not that good for us{wait:05}...

#### 16 ####
You know, my big sister has
a friend called a 'fiance'!
He didn't have any hair,
but he was sooo kind!

#### 17 ####
Our house is just over there!{wait:0F}

#### 18 ####
We have gathered together a
selection of many types of
accessories to protect you
from all sorts of damage!

#### 19 ####
Accessories not only make you
look better, but some of them
also have wonderous effects.{wait:0F}
I recommend you check them out!

#### 20 ####
From Aqua to Omega, we have
all the best items.{wait:0F} You can't
leave home without our tents
that totally restore you!

#### 21 ####
This city's other name is
"the town of steam" because
steam is being blown out of
everywhere the eye can see.{enter}
Due to this, whenever you go
out of your house you come
back pitch black all over!{wait:0F}
It also roughens your skin!

#### 22 ####
So why am I outside then?
You shouldn't be so picky
about such little details!
I have my reasons!

#### 23 ####
Big Joe
"What's the problem?{wait:0F} It's
much further in from there.
{wait:05}...{wait:05}Hurry up, now!"

#### 24 ####
Big Joe
"Did you change your mind?"{wait:0F}
    No way!
    Well, alright.

#### 25 ####
Big Joe
"{wait:05}...{wait:05}C'mon, stop the joshing.
If you change your mind at
any time{wait:05}...{wait:05} well you know!

#### 26 ####
Big Joe
"Hee-hee!{wait:05} There's something
really interesting beyond
here!{wait:0A} Do you want a look?"

#### 27 ####
Big Joe
"I sure swindled you!{wait:0F}
Hah-haaa! See you
around, sucker! Adios!{clear:3C}

#### 28 ####
Big Joe
"Only 5000G! Cheap, huh?"{wait:0F}
    No deal!
    It's a deal!

#### 29 ####
Big Joe
"Now then boy, you're not 
making fun of me, are you?"

#### 30 ####
Handed over 5000G.

#### 31 ####
Big Joe
"{wait:05}...{wait:05}Transaction approved!
The fun starts from here!
Never fear, I'll be here!"

#### 32 ####
Big Joe
"{wait:05}...{wait:05}Wha, huh!{wait:0F} I can't do
any business with guys who 
haven't got 5000G! So-rry!"

#### 33 ####
They say the world's a big
place, but there's no other
town nearly as big as our
capital city, anywhere!{enter}
They say there's an even
bigger city in the skies
above, but I ask you, who's
ever seen a floating city?

#### 34 ####
The attack by our enemy
kingdom Aveh on our Imperial
capital was really scary!{enter}
If that ever happens again,
I'm out of here! Perhaps I
might move to Nisan!

#### 35 ####
To the northwest of here is
the Imperial capital's D 
Block, which is used as the
criminal detention area.{enter}
It's a dirty place full of
criminals! You can come and
go freely through here, but
nobody would ever go there
out of free will or for fun!

#### 36 ####
They say that flying battleship
crashed in the north-western
area of D Block{wait:05}...{enter}
Luckily we escaped a direct hit.{wait:0F}
Boy am I thankful it wasn't
near our civilian area!

#### 37 ####
Oooh{wait:05}...{wait:05} Diana{wait:05}...{wait:05} During the
assault on our capital{wait:05}...{wait:05}
by Aveh{wait:05}...{wait:0F} she tried to 
save a child{wait:05}...{enter}
...{wait:05}Is there no god looking
over our world?{wait:05} ...{wait:05}Why?{wait:05} ...{wait:05}
And a woman like her!{wait:05} ...{wait:05}Is
this the fate god chose?

#### 38 ####
And I never got to{wait:05}...{wait:05}
tell her that{wait:05}...

#### 39 ####
Diana has gone back to look
after D Block{wait:05}...{wait:05}I'd like to
have her fix my ills, but I'm
too scared to go to D Block!{enter}
But after being assigned to
the civilian area she lost
her cheer a little{wait:05}...{wait:05}Perhaps
going back was best for her!

#### 40 ####
O.K., now to injure myself!
(But try not to let it hurt
too much!) And then{wait:05}...{wait:05}
it's off to see Diana!

#### 41 ####
What's with you, huh?{wait:0F}
I'm just passing by{wait:05}...{wait:05}O.K.{wait:2D}
So don't bother me.{wait:05} See ya!

#### 42 ####
My leg's hurt from running
around in circles all day!
I tell you, pushing yourself
too much isn't good for you!

#### 43 ####
Because of the long balance
in power, I let myself get
out of shape{wait:05}...{enter}
So now I am trying to build
up my physique by running 
around in circles.

#### 44 ####
But 
{wait:05}...{wait:05}it feels a little futile.

#### 45 ####
Using Aveh's raid on our
Imperial capital as a pretext,
they are going to start yet
another massive war effort!
When did this all start?{enter}
We have been at war for so 
long that we've forgotten
what we are fighting over{wait:05}...{wait:05}
Will there ever be an end
to all this fighting?

You cannot pass without

Sorry but I have to ask you
to withdraw!"

Imperial City Guard
"Please turn back and leave!"{clear:2D}

Imperial City Guard
"Sorry but this is my duty.{wait:0F}
I have to ask you to turn
round and go back!"{clear:3C}

#### 53 ####
Imperial City Guard
"It is after sundown already.{wait:0F}
journeying outside of the

is dangerous. I can not let
you leave now!"

#### 55 ####
Imperial City Guard
"D, didn't I tell
you that{wait:05}..."{clear:2D}

#### 56 ####
Imperial City Guard
"You're the Battling Champ!?{enter}
Beyond here you'll leave the
safety of the Imperial
capital and enter regions
where monsters roam!{enter}
Perhaps you don't need me
to tell you this, but
please do take care!"

#### 57 ####
Imperial City Guard
"{wait:05}...?{wait:0F} I guess I'm 
imagining things{wait:05}...{enter}
Anyway, welcome to Nortune,
the Kislev Imperial capital.
Greetings and salutations!

#### 58 ####
Imperial City Guard
"Oh, our reputation{wait:05}..."{clear:2D}

#### 59 ####
Imperial City Guard
"Nortune, our Empire's
capital, is a powerful
military state.{enter}
Bledavik, the capital
of the Kingdom of Aveh,
is at war against us."

#### 60 ####
Imperial City Guard
"{wait:05}...{wait:05}That's strange?{wait:0F} Haven't
I seen you somewhere before?{wait:1E}
Hmm, I must have the wrong 
person{wait:05}...{wait:05}errh, sorry."

#### 61 ####
Imperial City Guard
"Because martial law has
been imposed throughout the
whole Imperial capital area,
civilians can only pass in 
and out the 'front gate'{wait:05}...{enter}
There are also rumors about
convicts, who attempted to
escape by taking advantage
of the confusion during
Aveh's raid on our capital,
hiding out in these parts.

#### 62 ####
Imperial City Guard
"Hmm{wait:05}...?{wait:0A} Don't I know you 
from somewhere{wait:05}...?{wait:0A}
Oh well, guess not.{wait:0F}
Anyway, that's the way it
is, so please cooperate.

#### 63 ####
Imperial City Guard
"Sorry, but after sunset
nobody can pass through here!
That goes for Battling
Champions as well!"

#### 64 ####
Imperial City Guard
"This is the Kislev Imperial
capital barracks.
Entrance without permission
is prohib...{wait:05}{enter}
Hey aren't you the Battling
Champion?{wait:0F} Permission?{wait:05}
Why, you don't need that!{wait:05}
You're the Champ!"

#### 65 ####
Imperial City Guard
"Well then,{wait:05} please do enter."

#### 66 ####
Imperial City Guard
"The head-cook told us off.
I'd like to let you enter,
but for a while the barracks
are off limits!"

#### 67 ####
Big Joe
"Wait up, already will ya!{wait:0F}
Stop the hurrying, O.K.!"{clear:3C}

#### 68 ####

"Oooh,{wait:05} wait a moment!"{clear:3C}

Imperial City Guard
"Due to the attack on our

non-army personnel are not

Oops, sorry, my mistake!"

#### 85 ####
Imperial City Guard
"{wait:05}...{wait:05}Hey!{wait:0A} Isn't he the guy
in the 'wanted' poster{wait:05}...{wait:0F}
perhaps?"

#### 86 ####
Imperial City Guard
"{wait:05}...{wait:05}Yeah,{wait:0F} they say that
everyone has two or three
people that look exactly
like them in this world{wait:05}..."

#### 87 ####
Imperial City Guard
"Besides, even if he was
that 'wanted' guy, what
chance would mere guards
like us have against him?
He's the ex-Battling Champ!"

#### 88 ####
Imperial City Guard
"Let sleeping dogs lie, huh!"

#### 89 ####
Imperial City Guard
"Exactly! So even if we were
to see him here, then we'd 
just pretend that we haven't
seen him, O.K.!"

#### 90 ####
Imperial City Guard
{fast:FF}"Hey, that guy! He's the
ex-Champ who broke out of
the arena with his Gear
and is now 'wanted'!"

#### 91 ####
Imperial City Guard
{fast:FF}"Are you stupid!?"

#### 92 ####
Fei
"Damn!{wait:05} We're done for!"{wait:0F}
    Run away for now.
    Try to break through!

#### 93 ####
Fei
"We can't let them catch us.
Let's try running away
for the time being!"

#### 94 ####
Fei
"We've got to give it a try!
Doc! Elly! Let's try and
force our way through here!"

#### 95 ####
Citan
"{wait:05}...{wait:05} So it is the only
thing we can do, right?"

#### 96 ####
Elly
"Wait a second!
Do you really intend
to do this?"

#### 97 ####
Imperial City Guard
"Oh no! They're serious!"{clear:14}

#### 98 ####
Imperial City Guard
"There's no way we can
beat the Champion!!!"{clear:1E}

What are you doing here?"

#### 101 ####
Rico
"{wait:05}...{wait:05}I changed my mind.{wait:0F} I'll
leave Nortune for a while,
until things calm down.{enter}
You plan on seizing the new
mega-battleship 'Goliath'?{wait:0F}
Well, I'll give you a hand
{wait:05}...{wait:05}up to the city limits."

#### 102 ####
Fei
"{wait:05}...{wait:0F}
You don't want to fight
together with us?"

#### 103 ####
Rico
"{wait:05}...{wait:05}Make no mistake here!
I don't intend to become
friends with you guys!"

#### 104 ####
Rico
"I have something I have 
to do and I have to do it
on my own{wait:05}...!{enter}
When we leave the Imperial
capital's precincts, you 
can let me out anywhere
that is convenient, O.K.!"

#### 105 ####
Fei
"{wait:05}...{wait:05}...{wait:05}..."

#### 106 ####
Citan
"Well, at least until we
escape from the city area
we have got a secure ally.{enter}
That is good enough for us,
is it not!"

#### 107 ####
Citan
"Don't you think?"

#### 108 ####
Elly
"Well{wait:05}...{wait:05} yes{wait:05}...{wait:0F}
I suppose so."

#### 109 ####
Rico
"We have no time to 
dawdle around here!{enter}
We better get out of here
before other guards who
heard this scuffle come
causing us trouble!"

#### 110 ####
Rico
"So our destination is the
'north lands' of the outer
Imperial city area, right!{enter}
Then the Kislev Imperial
capital's military
facilities await us!{wait:0F}
We had better make haste!"

#### 111 ####
Fei
"Something interesting...?"
    No thanks, I'll pass.
    I want to take a look!

#### 112 ####
Big Joe
"What a party-pooper!"

#### 113 ####
Big Joe
"Oh!{wait:0A} So you do want to go
take a look, huh? {wait:05}...{enter}
Well, young man, if all in
this world was that easy,
huh? You know, I can't just
let you go see for free!{enter}
So...
let's make a deal then boy!
I'm talking money, friend!
Cash, mullah, wampum, G!{enter}
If I was just to get out of
your way and leave{wait:05}...{wait:05} well,
it would benefit you, but{wait:05}...{wait:05}
it'd be of no profit to me!{enter}
If I gain, you gain!{wait:0F}
That's the way it goes!{wait:05}
It's a fair trade, is it 
not, friend?"

#### 114 ####
Big Joe
"It's a bargain at 5000G!"
    No deal!
    It's a deal!

#### 115 ####
Big Joe
"Hey, you allowed me to
tell you this much, then
say no! That's not nice!

#### 116 ####
Handed over 5000G.

#### 117 ####
Big Joe
"{wait:05}...{wait:05}Transaction approved!
The fun starts from here!
Never fear, I'll be here!"

#### 118 ####
Big Joe
"{wait:05}...{wait:05}Wha, huh!{wait:0F} I can't do

What's with you, bro?{wait:0F}
I have info on your Gea{wait:05}..."{clear:2D}

Wha,{wait:05} wha,{wait:05} what the!?"

Just move it, O.K.!"

Hammer
"Waaaaaaiiiii----{wait:0F}t!"{clear:2D}

#### 127 ####
Fei
"It should be safe here.{wait:0F}
Now Hammer,{wait:05} tell me where 
my Gear is."

#### 128 ####
Hammer
"As the doc predicted, bro,
your Gear has been moved to
another dispatchment dock."

#### 129 ####
Citan
"So,{wait:05} where on earth 
is {name:0B:¥ô¥§¥ë¥È©`¥ë}?"

#### 130 ####
Hammer
"Not 'on earth', but under
the earth! It's in an under-
ground dock in D Block!{enter}
I've checked into it and 
found out that there are
two routes we can use to 
sneak inside.{enter}
The first one requires us
to enter via the Battling
Arena grounds.

#### 131 ####
Fei
"Well there's no way we can
sneak in via the Battling
Arena!{wait:0F} What's the second?"

#### 132 ####
Hammer
"The second way is a little
dangerous as it involves 
the supply train tunnel.{enter}
You have to get into the
tunnel's ducts and follow
them right through till
they lead to the docks.{enter}
But I couldn't find out
the duct's layout{wait:05}...{wait:1E}
Sorry, bro."

#### 133 ####
Fei
"{wait:05}...{wait:05}Oh that tunnel, huh?{enter}
Well, now that we have the
bomb problem off of our
necks, we might be able to
make a go of it!"

#### 134 ####
Citan
"Yes, but we are still left
with not knowing the times
that the trains pass by on.{enter}
Will a supply train pass by
at a time that is of any
use to us?"

#### 135 ####
Fei
"Not all of this has to be
decided now. Let's take our
time and plan it carefully!"

#### 136 ####
Fei
"Firstly Hammer, I'm sorry
to put you out, but{wait:05}...{enter}
Could you find out the days
and times that the supply
trains operate on for us
please?"

#### 137 ####
Hammer
"I'll get right on it, bro.{wait:0F}
Well then, I'll be off!"

#### 138 ####
Citan
"Shall we also return
to D Block for the 
time being?"
