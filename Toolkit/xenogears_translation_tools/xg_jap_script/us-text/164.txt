Maison
"Well said, young master!
This old man will follow
you to the pits of hell!"

#### 2 ####
Engineer
"The main engine and effect-
fins' oscillators are mostly
unharmed...{enter}
...but the electrical
connections between them
are wasted.{enter}
We are bypassing the main
connection and trying to
scrape together all the 
energy we can.{enter}
But it will only give us
70% of our usual maximum
power at best.{enter}
The propulsion-drills are
not damaged, but if the
sand can't be granulated
they might as well be.{enter}
We'll make battle speed 3
...only barely."

Sigurd
"He's been quiet since the
first surrender demand."

#### 4 ####
Sigurd
"Young master!"

#### 5 ####
Sigurd
"It sure looks that way...{enter}
Perhaps they have political
motives that involve Margie
or the young master..."

#### 6 ####
Engineer
"Young master...emergency
connections are complete.
Use the engine as you wish."

#### 7 ####
Bart
"...What? 
Who are
you...?"

#### 8 ####
Bart
"Surrounded, huh?
How are the repairs?"

#### 9 ####
Bart
"Sig! What has Gebler's
'Mister Puniverse' got
to say?"

#### 10 ####
Bart
"...{enter}
All personnel to battle
stations. Break through
is planned after the
connectors are up."

#### 11 ####
Bart
"Sig! Listen!{enter}
Surrendering isn't going to
change Nisan's fate.{enter}
We'll lose the Yggdrasil,
the core of our power in
saving Aveh and Margie.{enter}
I know it looks bad, but
you can still count on us!"

#### 12 ####
Bart
"Sorry, Old Maison,
I'm not dying today!!{enter}
Besides they don't look
like they're gonna hit us."

#### 13 ####
Bart
"That's probably it, Sig!{enter}
But they're forgetting one
thing...{wait:0A}
It's harder to bring in an
animal alive than dead!"

#### 14 ####
Bart
"Thanks!!{enter}
Alright let's...{wait:10}
go get those fools!!"

#### 15 ####
Bart
"W, what happened?"

#### 16 ####
Bart
"Is it heading...{wait:10}here?"

#### 17 ####
Are you strong?

#### 18 ####
I asked, 'Are you strong?'!
