    Hmmm, I dunno

Well I'm happy to hear
that... Even if you're
not being truthful!

#### 9 ####
Oh yeah...!?{wait:0A}
Well...there are a lot of
people who get lost around
here, y'know...{wait:0A} Hah!{enter}
(Now where was I...!?)

#### 10 ####
Young master, I've

#### 11 ####
What? Why am I here?
Well never mind that!
(It's not like I'm hiding
the fact that I broke the
wall or anything.){enter}
Oh, and by the way...
You can go through this
door to the Gun Room, or
go down the stairs to the
Engine Room.

#### 12 ####
I'll remember to obey
lights-out from now on...{wait:0A}
So, please come back alive.

#### 13 ####
What?{wait:0A} Can't find Fei?
N,{wait:05} no,{wait:05} I wouldn't know.{wait:0A}

on the job or anything...)

#### 14 ####
Young master, c'mon,
forgive me! Please!

#### 15 ####
What? Why am I here?{wait:0A}
Can't we put that behind us?{enter}
It's not like I'm being made
to stand here as punishment
for not obeying lights-out,
or anything like that, is it?{enter}
Beyond this door is the
Gear Hangar.{wait:0A}
The Gear Shop is located
in the Gear Hangar too!{enter}
Now be careful...!{wait:0A}
The Gears are so big that
you'll look very small and
you might get lost.

You may not have noticed it,
but even since the time you
guys came here, that tree's
grown a little bit.{enter}
It may only be little by
little, but it still means
our hopes and dreams are
also growing to fruition!

#### 17 ####
Oh, young master!{wait:0A}
This one's gotten bigger!{enter}
Right now, it's taller
than you, young master.

#### 18 ####
Grow bigger! Grow...!

#### 19 ####
This tree was planted
when the young master was
born. It grew along with
the young master.{enter}
With it, our hopes and
dreams grow to fruition
too...{enter}
Anyhow, the door next to
you is the elevator.{wait:0A}
Use the switch inside to
go up or down.
