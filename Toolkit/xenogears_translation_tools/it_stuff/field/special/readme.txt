File 1208 is Maggie's room. Using our version,
you'll have more space to translate

Margie
"Change party members?"
-> Yes
   No

We changed it into:

Margie
"Vuoi cambiare i
membri del gruppo?"<New>
->  Sì
    No

Hacking the "choose arrow" was a very difficult hack I'm not
going to explain (also, I'm not sure to remember it :P ).
Now, you have 3 free lines to translate the sentence
"Change party members?" instead of one.
To use this hack, simply copy&paste your translated file into
ours with Xenolater.


File 1248 is an edited version that must be used when playing
the card minigame WITH THE JAPANESE BUTTON CONFIGURATION.
